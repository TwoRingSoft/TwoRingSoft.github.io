        "content_html": "<p>I recently rewrote <a href="https://github.com/google-fabric/faboperation"><code class="highlighter-rouge">FABOperation</code></a> in Swift for an app that uses <a href="https://github.com/tworingsoft/pippin">Pippin</a>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">FABOperation</code> was originally a class written by <a href="https://twitter.com/mattie">Matt Massicotte</a>, so credit is due to him for the original, robust solution (explained later in the article). I later picked it up and added the compound operation class, some tests and a demo macOS app. After open-sourcing it while at Twitter/Fabric, I spoke about it at <a href="https://vimeo.com/210042860">mDevCon 2016</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All references here to Pippin’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncOperation</code> also apply to <code class="highlighter-rouge">FABOperation</code>–I’ll point out specific differences using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">FAB</code>-prefixed names.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s start with some background info on Apple’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">Operation</code> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">NSOperation</code> in Objective-C).</p>

<h1 id="operation-operation">Operation Operation</h1>

<p>An <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/operation"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Operation</code></a> encapsulates a bit of work, as a code application of the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?CommandPattern">“Command” software pattern</a>. It’s one of many patterns you may already know from using Apple’s SDKs: “Delegate” (<code class="highlighter-rouge">UITableViewDataSource</code>), “Abstract Factory” (<code class="highlighter-rouge">NSString</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSNumber</code>), “Observer” (KVO and <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSNotification</code>) and “Flyweight” (<code class="highlighter-rouge">UITableViewCell</code> reuse) among others.</p>

<p>By cordoning off logic and associated state into discrete pieces, you can write flexible, reusable and testable code. Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/226">WWDC 2015 Session 226: Advanced NSOperations</a> highlights how this architecture benefitted the WWDC iOS app, and my own presentation did the same for some of our tools at Crashlytics.</p>

<p>You can create plain ol’ <code class="highlighter-rouge">Operation</code>s and run them by calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">start()</code> or by placing them on an <code class="highlighter-rouge">OperationQueue</code>. Its constructors can accept <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSInvocation</code>s or closures, and you can add more logic in its <code class="highlighter-rouge">completionBlock</code> closure. For more customization, you can subclass it and override <code class="highlighter-rouge">main()</code>, where the business logic resides. You can use one or multiple queues, either serial or concurrent, to architect complex state machines.</p>

<p>The thing is, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Operation</code> is synchronous… if you want an asynchronous version, you have to build it yourself.</p>

<h1 id="why-asyncoperation">Why AsyncOperation?</h1>

<p>Imagine you want to encapsulate a network request, and you simply subclass <code class="highlighter-rouge">Operation</code> and initiate the request in its <code class="highlighter-rouge">main()</code> body. Two problems immediately arise.</p>

<p>First, if you place the operation on a queue, it won’t block subsequent or dependent operations from beginning before your network request completes. Once the request is started, like with <code class="highlighter-rouge">URLSessionDataTask.resume()</code>, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">main()</code> function returns, the operation is popped off the queue, and others that were waiting will begin, probably before they should. Dependent operations, possibly in parallel queues, will start too soon, maybe displaying UI for a default success path before an operation fails, or passing empty, stale or corrupt data to subsequent logic.</p>

<p>Second, you have no way to shuttle the network response to consumers of your operation. You could populate some properties on it, but how does your consumer know when to access them? <code class="highlighter-rouge">completionBlock</code> executes immediately after <code class="highlighter-rouge">main()</code>; you likely won’t have your response data that soon.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncOperation</code> solves the first problem by setting the <code class="highlighter-rouge">isConcurrent</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">isAsynchronous</code> properties to <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code>, overriding <code class="highlighter-rouge">start()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">main()</code>, and providing a way to manually finish the operation: <code class="highlighter-rouge">finish(withError:)</code>. As it turns out, though, there’s a lot more to the problem. <code class="highlighter-rouge">OperationQueue</code> uses KVO to start operations and pop them from the queue, depending on changes to its state properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">isReady</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">isExecuting</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">isFinished</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">isCancelled</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Managing transitions between these states in a concurrent environment presents a formidable challenge. And because <code class="highlighter-rouge">OperationQueue</code> monitors these changes via KVO, the appropriate KVO events must be dispatched before and after each state change. <code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncOperation</code> gates all state changes using a recursive lock, and uses a closure syntax to ensure KVO correctness.</p>

<p>To solve the second problem, we added a new closure, <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncCompletionBlock</code>, which passes back any errors encountered. Subclasses may also provide their own custom closures or properties to pass back typed data, but still need to call <code class="highlighter-rouge">finish(withError:)</code> for correct behavior on queues and in compound operations. For parity with <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSOperation</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">completionBlock</code> is still the very <em>last</em> thing executed, that is, <em>after</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncCompletionBlock</code>.</p>

<h1 id="why-compoundoperation">Why CompoundOperation?</h1>

<p>With <code class="highlighter-rouge">FABOperation</code>, we started architecting complicated business logic into state machines that could include network requests and interprocess communication, e.g. via <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSTask</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">XPC</code>. Eventually we found a few subroutines made of multiple operations that we wanted to reuse and manage as a unit.</p>

<p>We created <code class="highlighter-rouge">FABCompoundOperation</code> to handle executing a set of mixed sync/async operations, aggregate any errors encountered, and propagate cancellation. The set of errors is passed through via its own <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncCompletionBlock</code>.</p>

<h1 id="rewriting-in-swift">Rewriting in Swift</h1>

<p>I haven’t personally needed to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">FABOperation</code> since Crashlytics, but recently found a need, and wanted to use my own implementation delivered via Pippin. I decided to rewrite the classes in Swift as a way to refresh my memory and see if the design or logic could be improved–this often happens when I write things in a new language. Swift is very safe, so it helps surface plenty of things easy to miss in a dynamic language like ObjC–this time around was no exception. Let’s see some of the good and bad…</p>

<h2 id="successes">Successes</h2>

<h3 id="swift">Swift</h3>

<p>Having Swift code is <em>obviously</em> the best part about translating Objective-C into Swift :) But seriously, it substantially reduced the amount of code. It also eliminated some conditionally compiled ObjC code from <code class="highlighter-rouge">FABCompoundOperation</code> to handle <code class="highlighter-rouge">dispatch_queue_t</code> as both retain/release or, if building for systems <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1496328-dispatch_release?language=objc">starting with macOS 10.8 and iOS 6, ARC</a>. There’s even a bug here surfaced by a newer compiler warning in Xcode: we never called <code class="highlighter-rouge">[super dealloc]</code>! I found a few other logical errors:</p>

<h3 id="compound-completion">Compound Completion</h3>

<p>Compound operations used to try injecting compound completion attempts into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncCompletionCompletion</code> <em>as well as</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSOperation</code>’s stock <code class="highlighter-rouge">completionBlock</code>. So, every time an async operation would finish, there would be two checks to see if the compound operation was done: in both <code class="highlighter-rouge">competionBlock</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncCompletionBlock</code>. Because <code class="highlighter-rouge">completionBlock</code> always executes after its new async counterpart, we can safely use that as the sole check to see if any operation, sync or async, is finished. Aggregating errors from async operations is now its own injected closure, whereas before there was one closure that tried to do both jobs.</p>

<h3 id="compound-cancellation">Compound Cancellation</h3>

<p>I found an inconsistency in <code class="highlighter-rouge">CompoundOperation</code>’s completion attempt logic, where if it is cancelled at the time it tries to complete, it will finish with an error and then nil out the reference to <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncCompletionBlock</code>. However, it doesn’t nil it out in the case where it’s not cancelled and all operations have finished. I moved the nil-out of <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncCompletionBlock</code> into <code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncOperation.finish(withError:)</code>, so compound as well as regular async operations all treat <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncCompletionBlock</code> consistently, regardless of the final state.</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>Testing any concurrent code is tricky, and this is no exception. I ran into a few issues validating and fixing the old tests I’d written, and writing a few new ones to verify the behavior of operations in general in service of this post!</p>

<h4 id="kvo">KVO</h4>

<p>I brought over some old ObjC tests that exercised cancellation logic in async and compound operations. After adding some for stock synchronous <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSOperation</code>s, I straightened out some discrepencies around when and which completions blocks are executed, and also for some KVO events. I also hit a possible known runtime bug w.r.t. which selector names receive KVO events for operation state properties, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSOperation</code> sends updates on keypaths with the ‘is’ prefix, e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">isExecuting</code>, whereas my Swift <code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncOperation</code> sends them on the backing property names, e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">executing</code>; this despite explicitly sending it on the prefixed version in <code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncOperation</code>’s implementation, and the fact the everything still works on queues in the demo project. Some <a href="https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4397">filed bugs</a> and <a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/87398">discussions</a> were pointed out to me around <code class="highlighter-rouge">Operation</code> KVO, so it looks like work is still being done here.</p>

<h4 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h4>

<p>Originally, my test <code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncOperation</code> subclass would use delayed GCD async dispatches to simulate long running tasks. Now, I wanted to add some tests that exercise normal execution of operations, fulfilling expectations in all their completion blocks and for all KVO events. However <code class="highlighter-rouge">waitForExpectations(withTimeout:handler:)</code> blocks execution to wait for those expectations. I wound up removing the delayed dispatch; the time simulation doesn’t matter when verifying all the completion behavior is correct–by definition, an async operation requires <em>arbitrary</em> time to complete, so short==long for our purposes. (To see them work with time delays, check out the demo project mentioned at the end of the post.)</p>

<p>Similarly, I had trouble testing normal behvavior of compound operations. I could not find a way to allow their private operation queues to finish normal execution, that wouldn’t deadlock with the test’s attempt to wait for expectations. These test cases are currently commented out with a note; the demo operation is currently the best way to verify that multiple compound operations execute correctly on a queue.</p>

<h3 id="swift-to-objc">Swift-to-ObjC</h3>

<p>At the time we put <code class="highlighter-rouge">FABOperation</code> together, we chose to keep it Objective-C rather than the hot new language we now know and love: Swift. Matt’s original reasoning is still on the README as of this writing, and still holds today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are a huge amount of apps out there that have zero Swift in them. We didn’t want to force those apps to include the Swift runtime libs. This is a trade-off, and it’s one that we hope will become less and less necessary over time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I translated the async operations into Swift for Pippin, I wanted to keep the test and demo sources I had originally written in ObjC. This has the dual benefit of saving time rewriting that part, but more importantly it exercises usage of a now-Swift API back in ObjC land.</p>

<p>One component of the tests and demo is a set of <code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncOperation</code> subclasses. However, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/migrating_your_objective-c_code_to_swift#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH12-XID_67">ObjC classes cannot inherit from Swift classes</a>! There’s no way around this one: I had to rewrite <code class="highlighter-rouge">TestAsyncOperation</code> and the demo subclasses in Swift.</p>

<h3 id="swift-to-objc-1">Swift-to-ObjC</h3>

<p>Nope, I didn’t copypasta that last heading. Nobody ever said it’d be easy using Swift from Objective-C.</p>

<p>This one concerns <code class="highlighter-rouge">Swift.Error</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSError</code>. Originally, if <code class="highlighter-rouge">FABCompoundOperation</code> had one or more suboperations fail, it would pass an <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSError</code> back through <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncCompletionBlock</code> with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">userInfo</code> key mapped to an array of those errors. In the Swift version, I’d like to use an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Error</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">enum</code> instead of global error code variables, but then I’d have to attach an associated value to pass that array of errors, which doesn’t bridge to ObjC. There were also asserts on the error codes themselves in ObjC test code, which was lost in the translation to a native Swift error. So, while I did switch to an Error enum, I had to include a function to transform them back into <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSError</code>s anyways :/ Maybe one day, if native Swift errors somehow truly replace NSError, I’ll be able to remove the transform.</p>

<h1 id="try-it-out">Try it out!</h1>

<p>The original demo project I wrote is now located in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Examples/OperationDemo.xcodeproj</code>, so <code class="highlighter-rouge">pod try https://github.com/tworingsoft/pippin</code> will allow you to check out the demo straightaway! Right now, you can test sync, async and a compound operation composed of a mixture of both, and it will show you when each stage of each operation runs. You can start and stop the queue they’re on, switch it between serial and concurrent modes, or cancel the operations.</p>

<p>And of course, contributions are <a href="https://github.com/tworingsoft/pippin">more than welcome</a>, and I’d love to hear if you use <code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncOperation</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pippin</code> in one of your apps!</p>

Let’s see what I’ve been up to, how the process is changing, and what <code class="highlighter-rouge">changetag</code> does to help.</p>

<h1 id="keep-a-changelog">Keep a Changelog</h1>

<p>One thing I’ve started since the last writing about version numbers is trying to build a habit of keeping an up-to-date changelog. And wouldn’t you know it, there’s a standard for it: <a href="https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/"><em>keep a changelog</em></a>.</p>

<p>Once nice thing about standards is that it allows ease of automation. Once I have a predictable format, I can start writing code that exploits the consistency to shuffle things around for me.</p>

<h1 id="git-a-grip">Git a Grip</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tworingsoft/vrsnr">Vrsnr</a> helps change the version numbers wherever they may reside, via a consistent interface at the command line. I have a <a href="https://gist.github.com/armcknight/8c2def2f9c0ba6714611a28ce14f1a0e">Rake task to make the change and commit it to git</a>, which I’ve been copying around for a while now (I know, that’s gross–I’m thinking about how to share it, or integrate it into Vrsnr). Then I have a separate <a href="https://gist.github.com/armcknight/be6c3d33305b720cd48cba71e1088fc2">Rake task to create a git tag and push</a> to the necessary places (git remotes, dependency servers).</p>

<h1 id="put-the-ease-in-release">Put the Ease in Release</h1>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">changetag</code> extracts the relevant entry from your changelog and writes it into the message of a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging">git tag annotation</a>. This way your release notes are neatly encapsulated with the version number, all in the milestone mechanism provided by source control.</p>

<p>GitHub lists each tag you push under a “Releases” tab, and will include by default any message written into the tag’s annotation. You may also edit the release notes through the web UI or the GitHub API to make nicely formatted markdown notes. This is not yet done in <code class="highlighter-rouge">changetag</code> yet but is planned for the future. In the meantime, the notes are still listed there.</p>

Once I figured things out, I codified it into a repository holding a simple <a href="https://github.com/armcknight/rails-hello-world">Hello World! on Rails</a>. Then I wondered what it was like to set up some other backend systems, so I made a collection of Hello World! examples for <a href="https://github.com/armcknight/django-hello-world">django</a>, <a href="https://github.com/armcknight/sinatra-hello-world">sinatra</a> and <a href="https://github.com/armcknight/rails-hello-world">node</a>, all deployable locally or on Heroku. Of these, I think that Django actually was my favorite in terms of how the dev environment operates and how code is structured, even though I don’t like Python as a programming language very much.</p>

<p>Also, these are all interpreted languages, and I like to work with compiled languages for applications if possible. (I usually use interpreted languages for complicated scripting that’s too complicated for shell scripts.) I learned enough Rust to put together a Hello World!, and then it occurred to me that there’s another compiled language I can use on the server, that I already know well, and love: Swift!</p>

<p>So I created a <a href="https://github.com/armcknight/vapor-hello-world">Swift server Hello World!</a> using <a href="https://vapor.codes">Vapor</a>, which has quite an ecosystem around it today via <a href="https://github.com/vapor">vapor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vapor-community">vapor-community</a> on GitHub, which have tons of helpful tools for backend needs:</p>

They join a small but growing family of tools to help with software development. Here’s a bit about the newcomers and how I see that collection growing and staying organized.</p>

<h1 id="rebuild-sims">rebuild-sims</h1>

<p>At some point a few weeks ago I found I’d corrupted my installs of iOS simulators. I tried fixing it myself to no avail, partly because I was trying to wrap up a release for an app update (of course, with yhr timing). I looked around for a drop in solution online and found this gist: <a href="https://gist.github.com/cabeca/3ff77007204e5479f7af">simulator populator xcode</a>, but I had some issues with it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it tried to build <em>every</em> combination of device and platform, for things like watch + iOS</li>
  <li>it has to be copied and pasted from a Gist, and then I have to manage it from there</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I took the opportunity to rewrite it a bit to improve performance, and serve it in a Gem for ease of distribution and use.</p>

<h1 id="sync-forks">sync-forks</h1>

<p>I find a lot of useful code on GitHub, and when I want to use something in a project I try to <a href="http://tworingsoft.com/blog/2018/01/09/dependency-management-best-practices.html">safely isolate the dependency</a>, part of which involves forking it.</p>

<p><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">Forking a repository</a> in a DVCS really just means creating a new mirror, a new node in the graph of “remotes” (even your local clones of repositories are really remotes: try cloning from a local repository on your machine, and then look at that clone’s git remotes–they’ll be local paths), to which GitHub adds some helpful UX: if you fork a repo via the GitHub UI, your repository is tagged with information about the original one. Hence, the little “forked from original-owner/repository-name” link under a fork’s name on its GitHub page.</p>

<p>I currently have around 80 forks. I’ve tried keeping them up to date locally to maintain as much control as possible over my fate as a dependee, but that’s a lot of work. For a while I’ve wanted a way to automatically ensure I have a local copy of each fork.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sync-forks</code> uses the GitHub API via the <a href="https://github.com/piotrmurach/github"><code class="highlighter-rouge">github_api</code></a> Gem to get a list of all your repositories and clone those that are forks. In each local repo, the git remote <code class="highlighter-rouge">origin</code> will point to your fork, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">sync-forks</code> will add a new remote named <code class="highlighter-rouge">upstream</code> that points to the original.</p>

<p>Eventually, I’d like a way to automatically fetch new commits from <code class="highlighter-rouge">upstream</code>s and apply them (using <code class="highlighter-rouge">--ff-only</code> for safety) to the local default branch, and then push to <code class="highlighter-rouge">origin</code>. Maybe later a more sophisticated approach using <code class="highlighter-rouge">git pull --rebase</code> and a stored <code class="highlighter-rouge">rerere</code> strategy could be used for customized forks.</p>

<p>Here’s another pie-in-the-sky idea: automate <em>forking</em> for all your dependencies. I’m not perfect about going around and forking all the repos for dependencies I use in my apps, or even in these Gems. While it is true that package managers may leave caches or checkouts of dependencies in various places, it might be nice to archive them all on a personal server, perhaps. If <code class="highlighter-rouge">sync-forks</code> could crawl all of my Gem or CocoaPod dependencies, fork them on their respective platforms (if possible–GitHub would work, but a privately hosted Git repo probably won’t) and do the usual sync work, then you’d have a total mirror of all the software your apps need to work!</p>

<h1 id="tworingtools">tworingtools</h1>

<p>These are distributed in a Ruby Gem named <code class="highlighter-rouge">tworingtools</code>, which provided a nice little learning opportunity to me, since this is the first Gem I’ve created. I also have a set of tools distibuted via <code class="highlighter-rouge">Homebrew</code> in <a href="https://github.com/TwoRingSoft/homebrew-formulae">tworingsoft/homebrew-formulae</a>, but I’ve found that approach tougher. Going forward, I’d like to merge these collections.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tworingsoft/tools"><code class="highlighter-rouge">tworingtools</code></a> is currently all housed in a single repository, including specs, which I like. I currently have the Homebrew specs stored in a separate repo from the tools, introducing more complexity. Ultimately I’d like to combine those source repositories into <code class="highlighter-rouge">tworingtools</code>, and add them appropriately to the gemspec. All the better if I can also host the Homebrew specs in that same repository, and target both package managers.</p>

        "content_html": "<p>Recently I got an itch to practice some backend fundamentals, and set up a few different stacks from scratch. First up is Rails, something I’ve worked with in the past and know to be a very well automated full stack solution. I’ve used Ruby since 1.8.7, so am comfortable with the language.</p>

<p>Setting up the stack, however, is still a process I have not mastered. I hit several roadblocks along the way to getting a working Rails app running, as is tradition harkening back to every other time I’ve attempted it. Working with the Ruby ecosystem is <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2238">complicated enough</a> that a <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/cocoapods.rb">Homebrew formula</a> was created to encapsulate installing the CocoaPods gem, which has been another plentiful source of adventure for me while working on iOS.</p>

<p>This time, I started by following <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails5#create-a-welcome-page">Heroku’s guide</a> and hit two problems: installing nokogiri and pg, both with native extensions. I waded through an ocean of GitHub issues and Stack Overflow posts to cobble something together that finally worked. So, I’ll add my drops of knowledge to that yawning abyss. Here is a list of everything I did until I got a successful Rails app running locally.</p>

<ol>
  <li>configure rbenv:
    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">rbenv install 2.5.1</code></li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">rbenv rehash</code></li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">rbenv local 2.5.1</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>install/configure bundler:
    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">rbenv exec gem install bundler</code></li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">rbenv exec bundle config --global path vendor/bundle</code> # from <a href="https://gist.github.com/denvazh/9535921004d7208dd275">this GitHub Gist</a>; I like this model of keeping all dependencies in the project, instead of user/global directories, just like CocoaPods</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>suggested workarounds to install Nokogiri, from the macOS section of their guide <a href="http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html">“Installing Nokogiri”</a>:
    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install libxml2 pkg-confif</code></li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies xz</code></li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">xcode-select -switch</code> between my local versions of Xcode 10 and 9.4.1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" rbenv exec bundle</code> # ARCHFLAGS workaround for pg gem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6209797/cant-find-the-postgresql-client-library-libpq)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install xz</code> # don’t forget this if you uninstalled it earlier!</li>
</ol>

<p>Steps 4 and 5 are where I hit trouble. When bundling, I got some error messages about undefined symbols for the i386 architecture when building nokogiri with native extensions. I couldn’t find anything on the web pointing out my exact problem, but many similar ones, so I chipped away by trying a few different things I found. (I must admit that I don’t know which one alone would have fixed it. I tried resetting my machine and retracing all these steps again, only to have it work perfectly without hitting the same nokogiri issues.) The linked SO post in step 4 is the exact problem I had and I was able to translate the top solution for my needs (by removing <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo</code> usage and replacing it with <code class="highlighter-rouge">rbenv</code>).</p>

<h1 id="one-more-thing">One more thing…</h1>

<p>From here it wasn’t too much more to get to running the app in the cloud via Heroku. I had to fill in some steps of my own to get it working though–their guide did not have adequate coverage of local PostgreSQL usage. When I tried to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">rbenv exec bundle exec rails server</code> I got a fatal exception: <code class="highlighter-rouge">database "myapp_development" does not exist</code>. The <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.13-high-sierra">GoRails guide</a> filled in the gap there, where I’d hadn’t yet run <code class="highlighter-rouge">rails db:create</code>. I also wound up needing to do the following for that to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install postresql</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">createdb</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, rerunning the Rails server was able to get me to the Heroku tutorial’s welcome controller page. Whew… I have a working Rails app again! I committed it to <a href="https://github.com/armcknight/rails-app">a GitHub repo</a> for preservation.</p>

<h1 id="postscript">Postscript</h1>

<p>Funnily enough, I blew away some Ruby dependencies I use to compile this static site with Jekyll, Sass and a few plugins! I fixed it up, and it now uses the local <code class="highlighter-rouge">vendor/bundle</code> bundler path as well, and I even ran <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle package</code> and checked <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle/cache</code> into source control, while adding <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle/vendor/**/*</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code> (thanks to <a href="http://ryan.mcgeary.org/2011/02/09/vendor-everything-still-applies/">this guide to bundler dependencies</a>, which also enunciates dependency principles that resonate strongly with me; see also my previous writings <a href="http://tworingsoft.com/blog/2018/01/09/dependency-management-best-practices.html">on dependency isolation</a>).</p>

After publishing, a friend asked if I had heard of the <a href="https://github.com/antitypical/Result">Result</a> library, and if I’d considered using that instead of Swift errors. Indeed, I had used it due to its inclusion in <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift">ReactiveSwift</a>/<a href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa">ReactiveCocoa</a>, but had never in my own code or libraries’ API.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-tried">What I tried</h1>

<p>I took a generic function from my model layer, which inserts a Core Data entity and returns the instance as its own type instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSManagedObject</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">throw</code>s an error if the cast fails. I changed it from <code class="highlighter-rouge">throws -&gt; T</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">-&gt; Result&lt;T, CoreDataError&gt;</code> (typed error semantics is a nice plus for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result</code>). This small change at such a fundamental level precipitated many code changes, and because it’s a function in a framework used by several of my apps, more work lay ahead if I committed to the change. I wound up concluding that I didn’t care to replace all error handling with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result</code> in my own API, but I found it very helpful resolving a particular situation: combinatorial optionality in nonrethrowing function closures.</p>

<h2 id="combinatorial-optionality">Combinatorial optionality</h2>

<p>Lots of APIs return an optional result and optional error, like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/1407613-datatask"><code class="highlighter-rouge">NSURLSession.dataTask(with:completionHandler:)</code></a>, whose completion block provides parameters <code class="highlighter-rouge">(Data?, URLResponse?, Error?)</code>. Because optionals are a compiler feature, you’re forced to deal with scenarios like getting <code class="highlighter-rouge">nil</code> for all three parameters. According to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlsession/1410330-datataskwithurl?language=objc#discussion"><code class="highlighter-rouge">NSURLSession</code>’s docs</a>, this can’t happen:</p>

<blockquote>
	If the request completes successfully, the data parameter of the completion handler block contains the resource data, and the error parameter is nil. If the request fails, the data parameter is nil and the error parameter contain information about the failure. If a response from the server is received, regardless of whether the request completes successfully or fails, the response parameter contains that information.
</blockquote>

<p>Nonetheless, you must conceptually handle each case in code:</p>

<table class="alternating-table bordered-table">
	<tr><th>Data?</th><th>URLResponse?</th><th>Error?</th><th>Behavior</th></tr>
	<tr><td>nil</td><td>nil</td><td>nil</td><td><b>impossible</b>; should always have a URLResponse</td></tr>
	<tr><td>nil</td><td>nil</td><td>present</td><td><b>impossible</b>; should always have a URLResponse</td></tr>
	<tr><td>nil</td><td>present</td><td>nil</td><td><b>impossible</b>; should always have only one of either a Data or an Error</td></tr>
	<tr><td>nil</td><td>present</td><td>present</td><td>handle the Error (including passing it back to callers)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>present</td><td>nil</td><td>nil</td><td><b>impossible</b>; should always have a URLResponse</td></tr>
	<tr><td>present</td><td>nil</td><td>present</td><td><b>impossible</b>; should always have a URLResponse</td></tr>
	<tr><td>present</td><td>present</td><td>nil</td><td>pass the Data or a deserialized object or data structure back to callers</td></tr>
	<tr><td>present</td><td>present</td><td>present</td><td><b>impossible</b>; should always have only one of either a Data or an Error</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Only two of the eight combinations even make sense. I really want <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union">union</a> semantics: a way to tell the compiler that a reference can point to either one thing/type or another at a time. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result</code> achieves the same expressibility using Swift’s error throwing itself, along with enums and generics in a sort of Swift hat-trick. Funny enough, it’s the solution I found myself building towards when I sat down to implement my own union-y type specific to my app’s domain, instead of the general-purpose <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result</code> (starting from the Swift Language Guide’s recommendation to use <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Enumerations.html#ID148">enums with associated values</a>. There’s also <a href="https://github.com/robrix/Either">Either</a>, which generalizes the concept further, but its <code class="highlighter-rouge">.left</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.right</code> names seemed too generic to me, whereas <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result</code> has more specific terminology for the current domain: <code class="highlighter-rouge">.success’ and </code>.failure`.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">(URLResponse, Result&lt;Data, Error&gt;)</code> exactly transcribes what the docs say into code that’s enforceable by the compiler. Of course, it’d be even easier to have an invariant return type on a function that <code class="highlighter-rouge">throws</code> and error. Even then, combinatorial optionality is easier to deal with, via a few early exits from <code class="highlighter-rouge">guard let</code>s, and you only have to do it once. The problem lies in functions that don’t rethrow errors thrown in their closure parameters…</p>

<h2 id="nonrethrowing-function-closures">Nonrethrowing function closures</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/3017522-map"><code class="highlighter-rouge">map</code></a>ped over a Swift <code class="highlighter-rouge">Array</code>, you’ve used a function that <code class="highlighter-rouge">rethrows</code> Swift errors thrown from its closure parameter’s scope. It’s as simple as declaring a function as <code class="highlighter-rouge">rethrows</code> and the closure parameter it accepts as <code class="highlighter-rouge">throws</code>. Otherwise, any thrown errors must be handled inside that closure’s scope, and this is enforced by the compiler. (To see more, check out “Rethrowing Functions and Methods” under “Functions” in the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Declarations.html#ID362">Swift language reference’s “Declarations” section</a>.)</p>

<p>Any calls to nonrethrowing functions in a call hierarchy stop thrown error propagation at that point. For instance, imagine a user action results in saving some data to your local cache and then uploading the data over the network, with any errors presented back to the user. A simplified description of the flow of execution through different application layers might look like so: <code class="highlighter-rouge">UI -&gt; model -&gt; network</code>, with errors propagating backwards. If all layers had functions declared with <code class="highlighter-rouge">throws</code>/<code class="highlighter-rouge">rethrows</code>, then we could just <code class="highlighter-rouge">throw</code> an error all the way back to the UI layer, where a <code class="highlighter-rouge">catch</code> block would handle it and present a dialog to the user. However, because <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSURLSession.dataTask</code> accepts a closure and is not declared <code class="highlighter-rouge">rethrows</code>, you cannot <code class="highlighter-rouge">throw</code> any error in the first place for failures. You must design your call hierarchy to use async patterns (closures, delegates, notifications etc) and pass errors as optional parameters.</p>

<h2 id="my-app-clgeocoder-and-core-data">My app: CLGeocoder and Core Data</h2>

<p>At some point in my app, Core Data entities (returned from the same function I mentioned earlier) are populated with data returned from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clgeocoder/1423621-reversegeocodelocation"><code class="highlighter-rouge">CLGeocoder.reverseGeocodeLocation(_:completionHandler:)</code></a>. Like <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSURLSession</code>, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">completionHandler</code> closure passes back multiple optional parameters, in this case <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clgeocodecompletionhandler"><code class="highlighter-rouge">([CLPlacemark]?, Error?)</code></a>. Whereas with plain functions I’d <code class="highlighter-rouge">throw</code> an error all the way back from my model/network layers to the UI, now they all call closures passing something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result&lt;CLLocation, Error&gt;</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result</code> has mostly reduced the difference between propagating errors synchronously and async to one of syntax.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>From a reading of <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/ErrorHandling.rst#manual-propagation-and-manipulation-of-errors">Swift</a> <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/ErrorHandlingRationale.rst">docs</a> and <a href="https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/012545.html">evolution</a> and <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/throws-as-returning-a-result/1799">forum</a> <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/adding-result-to-the-standard-library/6932">posts</a>, it seems that the most likely thing we’ll see is an <code class="highlighter-rouge">async/await</code> mechanism that works with <code class="highlighter-rouge">throw</code>, and we can break out of the restrictive closures I mentioned (hopefully). Until then, I’ll keep using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result</code> as a way to maintain clean call/error hierarchies that, from time to time, must include that tough breed of closures.</p>

<p>If you’re weighing whether to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result</code> in your own API, here are the other pros and cons I came up with while experimenting with it:</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="pros">Pros</h1>

<h2 id="typed-errors">Typed Errors</h2>

<p>A Swift function may declare that it <code class="highlighter-rouge">throws</code> an error, but not which subtypes of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Error</code> they may be. You may attempt conditional casts in <code class="highlighter-rouge">catch</code> declarations, but you must always fall back to the “default” case of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Error</code> root type as well. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result</code> allows you to specify a particular subtype, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result&lt;String, MySwiftErrorSubtype&gt;</code>.</p>

<h2 id="no-combinatorial-optionality">No Combinatorial Optionality</h2>

<p>See: this blog post</p>

<h1 id="cons">Cons</h1>

<h2 id="structural-code-changes">Structural Code Changes</h2>

<p>Unless you decide at some point to convert the result’s error field to a thrown error, the change from <code class="highlighter-rouge">do-try-catch</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">switch-success-failure</code> permeates throughout your codebase. At first, there was no clear answer on where to make the switch for me, so I just passed the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result</code> all the way to my presentation layer. This changed a lot of code everywhere in my app, although in the end I found it comprehensible and concise.</p>

<p>Changing from a <code class="highlighter-rouge">do-try-catch</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">switch-failure-success</code> has its own tradeoffs:</p>

<h3 id="pros-1">Pros</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Clearer separation of happy path and failure modes: they’re literally labeled by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">success/failure</code> case names in each <code class="highlighter-rouge">switch</code>.</li>
  <li>I find <code class="highlighter-rouge">switch</code> boilerplate easier to cognitively filter out than <code class="highlighter-rouge">do-try-catch</code> boilerplate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cons-1">Cons</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Code ordering: <code class="highlighter-rouge">do-try-catch</code> imposes a specific order on your code statements and blocks. You must write the statements that depend on the result of the throwing call after that call, and the error handling must follow that in a catch block. You can’t write a catch block anywhere else. With <code class="highlighter-rouge">switch-failure-success</code>, you can write the <code class="highlighter-rouge">failure</code> case first, similar to an early exit with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">guard</code> (my preference), but you can also put the <code class="highlighter-rouge">success</code> case first. <code class="highlighter-rouge">switch</code> imposes no ordering on its case labels, so even though this is a small, pedantic nitpick, you must expend a little cognitive overhead each time to decide which case to write first. And if you have anything less than perfect memory and willpower, you will eventually swap the ordering in your code, introducing inconsistency.</li>
  <li>Nesting: you may have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">do</code> block that calls multiple <code class="highlighter-rouge">throw</code>ing functions at the same scope level. If each of those instead returned a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result</code>, they must be nested inside each other’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">switch</code> blocks, or use higher-order functions like <code class="highlighter-rouge">map</code> to recompose the results (further overloading the meaning of those function names, and requiring you to remember to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">flatMap</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result</code> as with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Optional</code>, and not <code class="highlighter-rouge">compactMap</code> as with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Sequence</code>).</li>

<p>Inserting a dependency requiring pervasive changes, that I don’t maintain, and that changes the way I express code execution, is risky. Changes in anything from Swift <code class="highlighter-rouge">Error</code>s, stdlib protocols, generics or closures could affect how Result operates, and maybe even necessitate code changes to fix API breakage. However small, there is a nonzero probability that I may one day have to rewrite the code that used <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result</code>.</p>

        "content_html": "<p>Many Xcode projects I’ve seen use multiple targets to build variants of the same application, when different build configurations would suffice. Of course, some of these are my own projects, which I’m fixing over time, but I’ve seen this in the majority of projects I’ve inherited as well. Let’s talk about what each thing is and some tips to help you decide which to use–for more information, here is an <a href="https://pewpewthespells.com/blog/using_xcode_targets.html">excellent and detailed writeup of targets, configurations and schemes</a>.</p>

<h1 id="targets">Targets</h1>

<p>An Xcode target represents a distinct application, or program that runs on a computer.</p>

<p>Even if they share a lot of the same code, deployments on iOS, Watch and TV are all separate applications. Those platforms are inherently different and are meant for unique use cases, hence different ways of doing things. Certain tasks may be better suited towards a particular platform, so even though you may be a bank with an app on a phone and watch, they probably do different things.</p>

<p>Unit test suites are other kinds of applications, as are all the other extensions you can deliver in an app, like iMessage sticker packs. Even though targets are also used for frameworks and libraries, I do not consider them to be applications–they are parts of applications. A cabin is made out of logs; would you call a log a cabin? I have a slightly different set of rules for them, which I allude to later.</p>

<h1 id="build-configurations">Build Configurations</h1>

<p>Suppose you’re developing that bank app on iOS. Due to certain export regulations, you may need to deliver a modified version to users in a certain country. For each of your features and bugfixes, a QA build must be generated for internal testing. Still another flavor of the app is sent to your client for on-site testing and acceptance before shipping.</p>

<p>All of these things can be achieved using build configurations. The differences for these types of things can be expressed in the following build settings:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS</code> to conditionally compile code</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">INFOPLIST_FILE</code> if you want to store things like server endpoints in your plist instead of in code</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">OTHER_LDFLAGS</code> to conditionally link certain frameworks, like intrusive debugging tools, or touch visualizers</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER</code>: different ids means you can have all the different app variants alongside each other, and</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME</code> helps you differentiate those variants, especially if you don’t want to vary <code class="highlighter-rouge">PRODUCT_NAME</code></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="-todos-and-donts">// TODO:s and Dont’s</h1>

<p>Do not create a target, configuration, and maybe even scheme, for each app variant. For an app with 3 variants, this creates 27 possible combinations. That is 24 too many! Even though you only hook up the right combinations today, others might not get it right later, and might be afraid to delete the unnecessary stuff.</p>

<p>You can’t compile different sets of source files between configurations, as those are defined in a target’s Compile Sources Build Phase. I’d argue that you should place [semi-]shared code into separate static libraries and link them in <code class="highlighter-rouge">OTHER_LDFLAGS</code>.</p>

<p>Each build setting’s configuration specialization can be further broken down by iOS/macOS/etc SDK versions. This is very helpful to SDK developers who don’t want to create a new framework target for each platform, when the code is largely identical. This may be possible to do with apps by defining things like <code class="highlighter-rouge">WRAPPER_EXTENSION</code> (and probably many other settings), but it almost certainly would break Xcode’s General and Capabilities panels for that target. While I encourage this practice for frameworks/libraries to avoid the explosion of MyLib-iOS/MyLib-TV/MyLib-Watch/MyLib-macOS targets, I would discourage it for apps. They are different things, and to do it for frameworks requires less twiddling with obscure settings. It probably also breaks</p>

<p>If possible, use <a href="https://pewpewthespells.com/blog/xcconfig_guide.html">xcconfigs</a>. Even if you don’t move all of the build settings definitions out of the GUI and into them, just defining the important different I outlined above can help a lot. This allows you to invoke <code class="highlighter-rouge">xcodebuild</code> with the same scheme/target and a different xcconfig per app variant you want to build with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-xcconfig</code> option.</p>

At the time, I was using it in an iOS app’s codebase, bumping its build and version numbers as I pushed out beta builds. But, as I worked on that and other apps that use <a href="https://github.com/tworingsoft/pippin">Pippin</a>, I also continuously updated it, and needed to push new versions of its podspec for consumption back in those apps.</p>

<h1 id="versioning-v2">Versioning, v2</h1>

<p>In Pippin’s repo, I’m still using the same Rake task as before, but with a few tweaks since I last wrote it (you can see the old version in the old post). Previously, it always popped a stash off the stack at the end, but that wouldn’t be necessary if nothing was stashed as part of running the task. Hence, changes from who knows when would’ve been placed in the working index, confusing the programmer; now it checks if any changes are present before stashing, and only pops a stash if there were changes. Also, it no longer creates a git tag… that’s coming later on in the post.</p>

</noscript>

<p>Afer running this in Pippin’s repo, the podspec’s version has been incremented and the change is committed with a descriptive message: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Updated version from 4.2.0 to 4.3.0 in Pippin.podspec</code>. Next, I run a new Rake task written to release the pod:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/armcknight/be6c3d33305b720cd48cba71e1088fc2.js"></script>

</noscript>

<p>This is what creates the git tag we mentioned earlier (using Vrsnr’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">--read</code> function), pushes that tag, and pushes the podspec to the CocoaPods trunk. The nice thing about separating the bumping of version and tagging is it allows you to do any branch work necessary for your git flow before creating the tag, so it doesn’t wind up pointing to orphaned commits or other strange things you might not want.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TwoRingSoft/Pippin/blob/develop/Rakefile">Here is the entire Rakefile I use in Pippin.</a></p>

<h1 id="the-devpod-cycle">The Devpod Cycle</h1>

<p>Once I’ve found something I want to add in Pippin for use in whatever app I’m in at the moment, my flow looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">pod install</code> in the app repo, pointed at my local checkout of Pippin in the Podfile</li>
  <li>make the changes in Pippin</li>
  <li>run <code class="highlighter-rouge">rake bump[minor]</code> (or whatever component needs it), then <code class="highlighter-rouge">rake release</code></li>
  <li>back in app’s repo, <code class="highlighter-rouge">pod install</code> without the path declaration to pick up the new version from trunk</li>
  <li>commit changes using new Pippin functionality along with any tracked CocoaPods diffs from <code class="highlighter-rouge">pod install</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Five steps to get the changes in my devpod, push them to trunk, and get them back in the app, with everything properly tracked in version control. The only other thing is that path declaration in the app’s Podfile–I don’t like having to hand edit that kind of thing, dirtying my git index. So, I use environment variables:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/armcknight/441d7f6b86e746cd619134ea64ce8c20.js"></script>

<noscript>
	<p class="caption">(Code snippet hosted at <a href="https://gist.github.com/armcknight/441d7f6b86e746cd619134ea64ce8c20">https://gist.github.com/armcknight/441d7f6b86e746cd619134ea64ce8c20</a>. Enable javascript to see them embedded here.)</p>
</noscript>

<p>With that, <code class="highlighter-rouge">pod install</code> grabs the production version, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">PIPPIN_PATH=/path/to/.../pippin pod install</code> grabs it from a local checkout (in Fish shell, <code class="highlighter-rouge">env PIPPIN_PATH=/path/to/.../pippin pod install</code>). So, I’m using the latter in step 1, and the former in step 4.</p>

<h1 id="pedantic-versioning">Pedantic Versioning</h1>

<p>I’m a strong believer in semantic versioning, because it makes reasoning about and automating dependencies easier. Just as well, I strongly believe in maintaining auditability and reproducibility through version control. <a href="https://github.com/tworingsoft/vrsnr">Vrsnr</a> helps you do both, please consider using it and helping make it better–it’s designed with extensibility in mind, to cover more types of dependencies, ecosystems and platforms!</p>

        "content_html": "<p>When the TouchBar was announced for the MacBook Pro, I was torn. On one hand, it felt gimmicky and not truly useful (suspicions I mostly confirmed after using one for a couple months). Most of the joy came from using TouchID. On the other hand, it showed that Apple was thinking about how they could do input differently on the standard form factor for work computing. It also shows where they might be headed: TouchBar is not the end goal, but the first step to something better.</p>

<h1 id="the-long-arm-of-apple">The Long ARM of Apple</h1>

<p>Rumors have swirled for years about how Apple wants to merge iOS and macOS, probably taking on more of the character of the former. This goes hand-in-hand with those about ARM Macs and more recently that Apple will again develop their own processors.</p>

<p>Touch macOS sounds nice in theory, but probably won’t work in practice–as evidenced by Microsoft’s attempts with the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/windows-8-disappointing-usability/">Surface and Windows 8</a>. Now, the Surface wasn’t <em>all</em> bad–that’s not the point I’m trying to make–but it showed how certain classes of application are still better suited to the old form factor of a physical keyboard and pointing device. That’s not to say <em>all</em> applications are–certainly plenty of apps are best used with multitouch input, and many others still benefit from it somewhat, maybe meaning that they’re really best suited for all three: multitouch + keyboard + pointing device.</p>

<p>The latest MacBook Pro has all three of these. Of course, the multitouch component, TouchBar, is still very much in its infancy. My assumption is that it is set to be expanded upon and mature into something different. What would that look like?</p>

<h1 id="happy-as-a-clam-who-just-2xd-their-screen-count">Happy as a Clam (who just 2x’d their screen count)</h1>

<p>I anticipate a future MacBook Pro with a non-touch, high-definition display as it has today, but with a full-size multitouch input display on the bottom. Basically, today’s rMBP with an iPad Pro covering the entire bottom enclosure. It might even–<em>gasp</em>-have a place to store a compatible Apple Pencil inside the enclosure.</p>

<p>This wouldn’t have been the first time a dual-screened clamshell were attempted. Some new entrants into this form-factor segment are the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/21/toshiba-libretto-w100-resurrects-the-classic-umpc-brand-with-dua/">Toshiba Libretto W100</a>, <a href="https://blog.ted.com/xo_laptop_redes/">One Laptop per Child’s XO</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/products/acer-6120-dual-screen-touchbook/review/">Acer Iconia</a>. Similar approaches have been tried with phones as well, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/26/2509284/kyocera-echo-review">Kyocera Echo</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011/06/23/prototype-dual-screened-2-in-1-android-smartpad-from-imerj-previ/">Imerj</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/17/16486484/zte-axon-m-dual-screen-phone-announcement-hands-on">ZTE Axon M</a>.</p>

<h1 id="software-will-eat-the-word">Software Will Eat the Word</h1>

<p>What started as the TouchBar will eventually swallow up, first the Trackpad, and eventually the keyboard. It’ll take over the trackpad first as concepts around display and touch input are combined, similarly to how they are on iOS today. Like the TouchBar does today, it will be able to display custom input views, but for more complex controls than just volume and brightness sliders. You’d essentially have an iOS device dedicated to input for the macOS system.</p>

<p>This leaves the venerable keyboard competing for space. It’s a hard tool to get rid of–for many professions, it still can’t be beat, like programming, publishing or anything else requiring substantial amounts of writing. It’s position of power is validated by the fact that it was emulated in the touchscreen interface for iOS. The downside there is that the on-screen virtual keyboard covers half of the screen, blocking the underlying content or even just the form you’re trying to fill in. And of course every now and then it’ll just lock up or crash–it is software, after all.</p>

<p>With external keyboards, the iPad suddenly feels much more productive, more spacious. In the case of our futuristic rMBP, we don’t have to make this tradeoff–if the physical keyboard were totally replaced by the touchscreen input, it wouldn’t need the main display at all. But, as a touch typist, I’d still be much slower than I was with physical keyboards. And as mentioned earlier, moving from hardware to software introduces reliability issues–this is the impetus behind many people remapping Caps Lock to Esc, which I happily did on day 1 (the closer reach has since proved wonderful).</p>

<p>The easy, and most realistic answer, is to just keep using an external keyboard when you need it. I’d personally have no problem with this; I already use one anyways (my 2014 rMBP’s internal keyboard has stopped working and I currently live 3+ hours from the closest Apple Store, and I can’t mail it and wait 3-4 weeks), and having the external keyboard <em>plus</em> the whole new touchscreen input would probably be nice.</p>

<p>But that’s no fun. What if there were a way to have the touchscreen input <em>be</em> the physical keyboard I want? They could simulate the tactile feel of keyboard keys clicking, those little bumps on the home keys, and their edges and spaces between them as you drag your finger across the keyboard, with their Taptic Engine. They could probably accomplish everything they need for trackpad/keyboard tactile feedback with two engines, centered where each hand would be placed for typing.</p>

<h1 id="the-primitive-programmer">The Primitive Programmer</h1>

<p>As a developer (I promise this isn’t the start of an Agile story), I am of two minds about physical keyboards. Using an iPad Pro with external keyboard and Pencil is a wonderful experience, and I get a lot done with that setup. Indeed, I got it with the intent to replace all pencil/pen work, except personal journaling, and it has performed beautifully. Even with the virtual keyboard, I’m faster and more accurate than hunt-and-peckers or even the fastest thumb-typers on iPhone (yes, even the rare person employing two thumbs plus an index finger). I assume the average iPad user does not need the external keyboard, and maybe even the average macOS user could get by with just an iPad-like one on their futuristic clamshell.</p>

<p>For programming, my bread and butter, I still need a physical keyboard, so I’ll carry one around until I can program without it. While Swift Playgrounds on iPad is nice for toy programs and demonstration, it has a long way to go to completely replace Xcode on macOS. Transitions like that should also be long and gradual, and having an iOS device together in a macOS device provides a nice avenue to incrementally shuttling functionality over. Today, it shows debug controls; tomorrow, it could be a Wakandan wonder that makes programming more like painting–and why not? Code today is poetry, after all!</p>

That app is being developed together with an SDK, for which we use CocoaPods as its distribution mechanism as well as for devpod setup. In the SDK, I wanted some of these custom configurations to compile with no Swift optimizations so I could debug, while other configurations intended for release should have whole module optimization enabled.</p>

<p>I already knew that I could set build settings from a podspec, but I’ve never done this <em>per configuration</em>. I found this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/34200599">Stack Overflow answer</a>, where unfortunately the author notes that <a href="https://pewpewthespells.com/blog/xcconfig_guide.html#ConditionalVariableAssignment">conditional variable assignment</a> doesn’t work with podspecs’ <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#pod_target_xcconfig"><code class="highlighter-rouge">pod_target_xcconfig</code></a>. (Check out this GitHub issue on <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/7133">CocoaPods support for conditional variable assignment</a>.)</p>

<p>In my particular case, needing to override <code class="highlighter-rouge">SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL</code> presents an additional challenge. Contrary to the findings of the SO post, I did see an xcconfig written to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pods/Target Support Files</code> with all the configuration-specific settings, and saw it reflected in Xcode’s Build Settings GUI editor. Here’s the issue: CocoaPods hardcodes the default values for this setting, but writes them to the pbxproj <em>Target</em>-level settings, thus <a href="http://tworingsoft.com/blog/2017/01/28/xcode-build-setting-inheritance-and-precedence.html">overriding my xcconfig settings</a>. If they instead wrote it to the <em>Project</em>-level, they’d be overridable by anything set in <code class="highlighter-rouge">pod_target_xcconfig</code>. (See <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/blob/c39a015920c4c15701c8383aa240b7b3207a4ed9/lib/xcodeproj/constants.rb#L333"><code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJECT_DEFAULT_BUILD_SETTINGS</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/blob/c39a015920c4c15701c8383aa240b7b3207a4ed9/lib/xcodeproj/constants.rb#L226-L230"><code class="highlighter-rouge">COMMON_BUILD_SETTINGS</code></a> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">constants.rb</code>, and <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/blob/c39a015920c4c15701c8383aa240b7b3207a4ed9/lib/xcodeproj/project/project_helper.rb#L51">project_helper.rb</a> where <code class="highlighter-rouge">COMMON_BUILD_SETTINGS</code> is accessed via <code class="highlighter-rouge">new_target</code> -&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">configuration_list</code> -&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">common_build_settings</code>.)</p>

<p>Fortunately, there’s the venerable <code class="highlighter-rouge">post_install</code> hook, where we can modify targets’ build settings, just like was once required for <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/5521"><code class="highlighter-rouge">SWIFT_VERSION</code></a> (That workaround has since been obviated with the root specification <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#swift_version"><code class="highlighter-rouge">swift_version</code></a> as of <a href="http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-1.4.0/">cocoapods 1.4.0</a>–ctrl-f ‘Swift Version DSL`, it’s a ways down. The catch here is that the SDK maintainers must take up this change.).</p>

<p>So, in my Podfile, I wrote the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
        if target.name == 'MyDevPod'
            target.build_configurations.each do |config|
                if config.name == 'My-First-Config'
                    config.build_settings['SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL'] = '-Onone'
                elsif config.name == 'My-Second-Config'
                    config.build_settings['SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL'] = '-Owholemodule'
                # ...
                # and so on for the other configurations
                # ...
                end
            end
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This is also <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/4439">recommended</a> by a few folks in a discussion in particular about <code class="highlighter-rouge">SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL</code>. There’s even a <a href="https://github.com/jedlewison/cocoapods-wholemodule">plugin</a>. It’s certainly a fine solution, and in general the approach enables all sorts of customizations.</p>

<p>But then I found out about the Podfile’s <a href="http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#project"><code class="highlighter-rouge">project</code> directive with <code class="highlighter-rouge">build_configurations</code> hash</a> (h/t to <a href="http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/cocoapods-and-custom-build-configurations/">mokacoding’s article on the subject</a>, which is almost 4 years old now–the only difference being that <code class="highlighter-rouge">xcodeproj</code> has been renamed to <code class="highlighter-rouge">project</code>). So, I was able to remove the <code class="highlighter-rouge">post_install</code> hook in favor of this one-liner at the top of my Podfile:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>project 'MyProject', 'My-First-Config' =&gt; :debug, 'My-Second-Config' =&gt; :release # and so on for the other configurations
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This works because CP have coded the desired settings between Debug and Release, so that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">project</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">build_configurations</code> hash maps to the settings I had set using <code class="highlighter-rouge">post_install</code> previously. I prefer defining these in a first-class Podfile construct like <code class="highlighter-rouge">project</code> as opposed to a more arbitrary-code solution such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">post_install</code>.</p>

<p>not to mention all the <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/">forays</a> into <a href="http://lolcode.org">stranger</a> <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck">realms</a>.</p>

<p>In my experience, developing on Apple platforms offers the most advanced and innovative tools and languages I’ve used. I only scratched the surface with Visual Studio, but many people I’ve worked with, even on iOS/Mac, see it as the most powerful (and .NET is a huge framework). Also, honorable mention for Jetbrains’ IDEs, which seemed very powerful the relatively small amount of times I’ve used them.</p>

<p>In the end, Apple has brought together the largest collection of diverse and powerful tools and made them accessible in the most mainstream way. Of course, many many powerful tools are at programmers’ disposal, obviously too many to cover in a blog post: valgrind, Hopper, dependency managers, the various tools in all the other IDEs mentioned above and all their competitors, and even Apple’s Instruments and other static and runtime analysis tools in Xcode. The purpose of this post is to talk about the tools that help programmers produce actual code and how they interact and coevolve with our psychology, and what I’d like to see next. And of course, all through the lens of Apple technologies–in this case, Xcode and Swift Playgrounds for iPad; there’s too much good stuff out there and I’m most familiar with Apple tooling these days.</p>

<h1 id="paradigms">Paradigms</h1>

<p>Of course, this is not to diminish the breakthroughs that each generation of tools have achieved. As the <a href="https://www.simplethread.com/software-complexity-killing-us/">complexity of software</a> has grown, so have new tools and <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/01/29/the-paradigms-of-programming/">methods</a> been developed to cope with that complexity. This holds true for leaps from punchcards (numbering and patches) to assembly to the high level languages we use today. Within modern languages, we’ve seen several high-level paradigms emerge: imperative, procedural, declarative, functional, logic/object/aspect oriented, reflective, event-driven and constraint-based (see this <a href="http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/paradigms/">excellent overview</a> and <a href="http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~leavens/ComS541Fall97/hw-pages/paradigms/major.html">other</a> <a href="http://people.cs.aau.dk/~normark/prog3-03/html/notes/paradigms_themes-paradigm-overview-section.html">introductions</a>).</p>

<p>Developing on Apple platforms offers a chance to use many of these paradigms. You can write assembly and debug it, even that of a program written in higher level languages. Smalltalk brought objects to the procedural world of C to create <a href="http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/The_History_of_Objective-C">Objective C</a>. Later ObjC and now Swift have closures to compose functional programs, and libraries like <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa">ReactiveCocoa</a> brought event-driven concepts into the mix. Hints of AOP lurk in Cocoa, with things like the <code class="highlighter-rouge">UIAppearance</code> proxy, and with Objective C swizzling and libraries like <a href="https://github.com/steipete/Aspects">Aspects</a>, you can cut across any dimension of your app. In general, the Objective C runtime allows for introspection of your program as it runs. And while you can even write declarative code with <a href="http://nshipster.com/kvc-collection-operators/">KVC</a>, NSPredicate or SQLite, you’ll need to write it all inside string literals. AutoLayout is a constraint-based paradigm, and even has its own “Visual Format” DSL, also coded in string literals.</p>

<p>Other more specialized concepts exist in various languages: [un]checked exceptions, generics, optionals and concurrency are a few. All of these are at your disposal in some fashion in Objective C and Swift–both have exceptions, unchecked and checked (respectively). Limited generic-like syntax exists in Objective C with <code class="highlighter-rouge">id&lt;Protocol&gt;</code>, and the later collections generics emerged for compatibility with Swift’s much more robust generics system. A rich concurrency ecosystem offers POSIX threads, NSThread, run loops, GCD and NSOperation, along with POSIX mutexes, <code class="highlighter-rouge">@synchronized</code> and several types of locks. Probably one of Swift’s most notable features is its first-class optionals with its own syntax, a concept backported to Objective C as nullability macros whose confusing helpfulness remind me of <code class="highlighter-rouge">const</code>-correctness in C++.</p>

<h1 id="domain-specific-languages">Domain Specific Languages</h1>

<p>Beyond Swift and Xcode, there are many problems where it might make sense to use a specialized language well-suited to describe the problem and solutions. Many are still built on the high-level general purpose languages of today, like C/C++. <a href="https://github.com/LiXizhi/NPLRuntime/wiki">Neural Parallel Language</a> (NPL) is one such example, and the <a href="https://blockstream.com/simplicity.pdf">Simplicity</a> [PDF] blockchain language is another. Another interesting component of Simplicity is that its authors formally verify their claims with Coq (formal verification and automatic proving are a fascinating world I have only just begun to explore, with other entrants like Julia and ML). With DSLs built on top of C++ and the ability to interface with it, our general purpose high-level languages of today could be the glue that holds together the programs of tomorrow written in more specialized dialects.</p>

<h1 id="plaintext">Plaintext++</h1>

<p>In theory, all of this can be done using nothing more than a text editor and a terminal, however unpleasant it might be. Consider the most notable difference when switching from an IDE to plaintext: no more syntax coloring! This simple enhancement allows much faster visual scanning of source code. But it doesn’t preclude you from understanding that code if it goes away. Syntax coloring, however, is just the beginning of the journey towards powerful IDE-assisted programming.</p>

<h2 id="ide-assistance">IDE Assistance</h2>

<p>For all its <a href="http://www.textfromxcode.com">faults</a>, Xcode is a remarkable piece of software that I fell in love with right away. It can jump to definitions and its Assistant editor can show sub/super/sibling classes, callers/callees (entire call hierarchies are navigable in the Find navigator), includes and including files (for ObjC), associated IB files, and preprocessed or assembled versions of source. It has a Version editor allowing side-by-side views of how a file has changed over time, as well as blame and log views, and you can git-blame any line of code via contextual menus.</p>

<p>Another very powerful tool IDEs allow us to easily wield is refactoring. Find and replace can do many things, as can regular expressions, but program code can contain all sorts of <a href="https://github.com/Droogans/unmaintainable-code">sneaky gotchas</a> that you can easily miss with a search, but are obvious to a compiler. Sadly, Xcode’s refactoring is among the worst I have used in a modern IDE, with IntelliJ/Netbeans/Eclipse having the best–must be something about that static typing in Java!</p>

<p>Features like these help give developers comprehensive understanding of ever more complex codebases and enable them to easily change widespread structural components. As such, they may be indispensable parts of many’s development process. As IDEs become more tightly integrated with the languages they serve, less language features–manifested as written source code–are required to uphold the same structures. I worry that programs’ source code may become incomprehensible if viewed without the required IDE.</p>

<h2 id="metaprogramming">Metaprogramming</h2>

<p>Is the metaprogramming of today the programming of tomorrow? Was writing Fortran or Smalltalk like metaprogramming assembly, just like that must have been to punchcards? Is evolution of programming languages related to the abstraction level of code generation, and does that abstraction level continue on until you just say “give me a program that makes a broken cat gif resembling Nicholas Cage and posts it to my Twitter every day.” (I assume that by the time we reach this capability, all problems actually worth solving will be solved, people will be freed from the shackles of laboring for the bourgeoisie and live utopian lives of leisure.)</p>

<p>Metaprogrammatic code generation exists in Objective-C in many ways: as <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="k">@property</span></code> automatic setter/getter synthesis, and more recently as generated headers for Swift interfaces. You can also generate class definitions from Core Data model descriptions. Swift itself has numerous examples of automatic code generation, like Objective C bridging itself, with a more recent example being <code class="highlighter-rouge">Codeable</code>. The community is usually ahead of the institution, and the same holds true for Swift. <a href="https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery">Sourcery</a>, a tool I admittedly have not explored, enjoys a lot of popularity today. All of these (except maybe Sourcery) happen invisibly at some point during compilation–they don’t leave code behind for you to read or check into source control (at least not easily or by default–things like Core Data class generation do have options to make generated code more accessible, and you can find generated Swift-to-ObjC headers in Derived Data).</p>

<p>Besides code generation itself, Swift has an abundance of keywords and constructs that encapsulate complex logic. <code class="highlighter-rouge">lazy</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">defer</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">didSet</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">associatedType</code> introduce effects that are removed from the place in code they appear, some more than others. Other concepts like protocol composition, generics, optionals, anonymous block parameters and tuple members and keypaths may combine to create extremely complicated code. <a href="https://alisoftware.github.io/swift/pattern-matching/2016/03/27/pattern-matching-1/">Pattern matching</a> is so powerful, it seems harder to me to know whether or not using an enum is appropriate. <code class="highlighter-rouge">map</code> can be used to transform a collection or unwrap an optional (which is a collection), whereas <code class="highlighter-rouge">flatMap</code> is like <code class="highlighter-rouge">map</code> followed by <code class="highlighter-rouge">filter</code>ing for non<code class="highlighter-rouge">nil</code> elements.</p>

<p>With so much “invisible code” via high-level abstractions and just-in-time code generation, source code becomes hard to reason about. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2925295/#!po=0.986842">Working memory</a> [PDF] can only hold around 7 separate ideas in mind at once: maybe an overarching goal of a feature or bug, the current plan of attack, a couple intricately connected structures in code like aspects, a couple automatic code generation processes, and it’s not hard to imagine writing a crasher because you forgot to check if some API was introduced after your deployment target, or because a data structure has some funny interplay between ObjC/Swift you didn’t know about or forgot. It’s difficult to do in Xcode; to do so with TextEdit + Terminal seems impossible.</p>

<h2 id="visual-programming">Visual Programming</h2>

<p>What we are going to need are new ways to organize program specifications besides text, or at least novel ways to use text to describe complicated structures, that allow us to efficiently work within the limits of our working memory. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) have five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_61131-3">languages</a>, two text-based and three graphical. <a href="https://ballerinalang.org">Ballerina</a> has equivalent graphical and textual syntaxes. For lovers of the abstract, <a href="http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html">Piet</a> programs are more like pictures than code.</p>

<p>Probably the most well known visual programming tool is the WYSIWYG editor. Xcode’s is called Interface Builder (IB) and is the most advanced I’ve used. Individual views and view elements can be defined in separate files, and Storyboards (the only integrated tool of its kind that I have seen in an IDE) can define multiple views and the interactions between them, and reference other Storyboards–really, they are composable state machine diagrams. These days, I do not use IB because it is very hard to maintain the backing XML–I’d rather maintain the Swift code and derive reusable code utilities to build UI. (Although lately my usage of “flow controllers” are seeming an awful lot like storyboards-in-code… maybe one day the pendulum will swing back and I’ll again use IB!)</p>

<p>Xcode has many other GUI-based editors for documents backed by plaintext code. The Core Data visual data model editor  complements the series of dropdown menus and text boxes in the normal model editor. That mode is similar to the visual Plist editor, the default way to view a Plist, even though you can also view it as its XML source (as can any IB file, or even the .xcodeproj itself). It also has SpriteKit and SceneKit editors (for 2D and 3D worlds, respectively), which I unfortunately have zero experience with. The build settings editor is backed by a powerful text-based <a href="http://tworingsoft.com/blog/2017/01/28/xcode-build-setting-inheritance-and-precedence.html">configuration system</a>.</p>

<p>Besides Xcode, Apple has several other visual programming tools. Automator organizes individual tasks and snippets into flows. Quartz Composer arranges tasks into nodes that can be connected together in a way very reminiscent of how <code class="highlighter-rouge">IBOutlet</code>s are connected to objects in IB. Clearly these tools are not new or one-off explorations, but they also don’t feel mainstream in the way text-based code still reigns supreme.</p>

<h2 id="ascii-art">ASCII Art</h2>

<p>Looking back at text-based code, some options exist to get more graphical, even if they’re just glyphs like <code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code> that can replace wordy functions like <code class="highlighter-rouge">add()</code>. Swift allows identifiers containing Unicode characters, so I could make a new function (<em>not</em> operator, unfortunately, in Swift) named <code class="highlighter-rouge">➕</code>. Specialized fonts exist with ligatures to pictorialize common operators like <code class="highlighter-rouge">!=</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;=</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">-&gt;</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">===</code>. See <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14821446">this hackernews discussion</a>. You can even name that nasty workaround hack function with <a href="https://twitter.com/ndrewmcknight/status/788851212582055936">zalgo text</a> to scare off the weak-willed.</p>

<p>In addition to changing what glyphs we use to compose code, we can also overlay new information on top of the code. Things like highlighting all instances of an identifier, or showing compilation warnings and errors where they occur. Swift Playgrounds for iPad introduced some new concepts for decorating and performing simple refactors on control structures like switch and if/else, as well as functions. This seems like the tip of the iceberg of what is possible, but is a great start, and I think works especially well for learning. I’ve very limited use with Playgrounds for iPad, mostly solving specific algorithmic problems, which is a delight with the graphical <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop">REPL</a>: I usually write a function, pass in a set of inputs, and then graph the outputs to see if it makes sense. (REPLs are another instance of something that has been around for a while, but Apple has taken to a new level.) Although my usage has been simple, people build up and tinker with entire UI frameworks using playgrounds.</p>

<p>One thing I’d love to see is the ability to annotate lines of code by different responsibility, like logging, analytics, error handling or business logic. Then, the ability to “fold all” of a particular type while viewing a code file. Essentially, defining different cross-sections or dimensions of code, with the ability to hide types of code you don’t care about at any given time. Logging and analytics can really clutter up business logic, but I’d prefer to keep it all together and take different “views” on it instead of using more magical aspect oriented solutions, from a maintenance perspective. Sort of like those anatomy books with a bunch of clear pages that show each organ system overlaid on a skeleton, code editors could also color or decorate each “type” of code differently while they’re visible.</p>

<h2 id="conversational-code">Conversational Code</h2>

<p>Using the new source editor in Xcode 9, I find myself going back and forth with the swift compiler for trivial things like where to put all the <code class="highlighter-rouge">?</code>s, or no longer needing <code class="highlighter-rouge">Void</code> in a closure’s parameter list. It would be nice if SiriKit could be used so that I could just talk with` the computer, which is much faster/easier than keystrokes, which are faster than mousing/clicking on the little radio buttons for issues in the source editor. There are folks out there today who <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8SkdfdXWYaI">dictate</a> all <a href="http://handsfreecoding.org/2015/03/14/dictating-code/">their</a> <a href="http://vocola.net/programming-by-voice-FAQ.html#section1.">code</a>.</p>

<h1 id="onwards">Onwards</h1>

<p>It’s been a lot of fun, first learning to program, and then seeing all of the amazing tools people have created to build programs. As I like to do, it’s exciting to take the progress I’ve seen over the last two decades and extrapolate it into the future (with an exponential growth curve of course). As new software, paradigms, and even hardware are invented, creating applications could become as different from what it is today as IB + Swift is from punchcards–what will that look like?</p>

Some notable examples are <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm">leftpad</a> and a more recent article on <a href="https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5">hackernoon</a>.</p>

<p>While NPM was the unfortunate victim in both of these cases, the problems of removed packages breaking builds, malicious packages either taking their place or masquerading as real ones with slight typographical differences in naming, or just pulling in unreviewed dependencies are not problems with the tooling. They are PEBKACs, ranging from innocent mistakes to failures to fully harness the power of the tools at hand.</p>

<h1 id="do-not-trust-dependencies">Do not trust dependencies.</h1>

<p>I’m as guilty as anyone of pulling in dependencies without meticulously reviewing every line of code. In most cases you just aren’t going to understand it the same way as if you just build it yourself. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t strive to understand those dependencies that we must use. I’ve gotten better at it and continue to strive for improvement.</p>

<h1 id="do-not-trust-that-dependencies-will-always-be-there">Do not trust that dependencies will always be there.</h1>

<p>One thing I’ve been better about the past few years is to always fork dependencies. How you do you know it will be there the next time you need it? How do you know the maintainers will not rewrite history and remove a release you depended on?</p>

<p>In  circles that use CocoaPods, this comes down to a dogmatic debate over whether or not to check in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pods/</code>, <a href="http://tworingsoft.com/blog/2017/04/12/source-control-management-vs-dependency-management.html">which I do</a>. That way, the only thing that matters is whether you can access the project you own–if you can’t get to that, it doesn’t matter whether you can get your dependencies or not. You aren’t doing work.</p>

<p>Forking allows you another layer of control on when you update your dependencies. You can view the code diff when you bring upstream commits into your fork. Then you can update consumers from your fork.</p>

<h1 id="do-not-trust-dependency-managers-central-stores">Do not trust dependency managers’ central stores.</h1>

<p>Do you trust that just because you declare a dependency on SomePackage 1.2.3, that it will be there the next time your CI box performs a fresh clone and tries to build? Do you trust that the servers that deliver packages and metadata are up when you need them to be?</p>

<p>Yet another thing CocoaPods allows is to use a <a href="http://guides.cocoapods.org/making/private-cocoapods.html">private podspec repo</a> to serve the dependencies. If you like control over your dependencies, then this decentralized approach is superior to relying on <code class="highlighter-rouge">trunk</code>. Admittedly, I have not taken this step yet with my own projects, but it’s worth noting for those who haven’t tried it. Another thing I have yet to dive deep into is <a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage">Carthage</a>, which is always decentralized.</p>

<h1 id="do-not-trust-ensure">Do not trust. Ensure.</h1>

<p>I’ve learned from experience not to trust computers–rather, that people are able to perfectly program them–so I remove as much dependency on them to do the right thing as possible. Instead, exert as much control as is available to you, to ensure that every bit of code you need is available to you at all times, and that it is what you expected.</p>

It contains a lot of bug fixes and tweaks, but the addition of some new Core protocols are what I’m most interested in.</p>

<h1 id="alerter">Alerter</h1>

<p>Every app is going to need a way to display errors or other timely information (or even encourage users with a pat on the back). Introducing a protocol to do so enables other parts of Pippin to show an alert should the need arise, and for consuming apps to use and switch alerting solutions without changing callsites. An adapter to <a href="https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages">SwiftMessages</a> is provided as well.</p>

<h1 id="fonts">Fonts</h1>

<p>This is a foray into describing the look and feel of an app in a general way. It is used in the InfoViewController, and could open up more reusable UI to be delivered in Pippin. Because UIAppearance is already a declarative API, it isn’t clear to me if it can or should be abstracted in a useful way at this time.</p>

<h1 id="inapppurchasevendor">InAppPurchaseVendor</h1>

<p>If you want any return on the investment of time that goes into developing an app, then you need a way to license it. One way to do that is to offer purchases of things within your app itself. Usually a server is involved that provides the details of the products, and which ones the user has already purchased; this protocol describes the operations to get those details.</p>

<h1 id="environment">Environment</h1>

<p>As a bonus, there’s also a struct that contains references for all the Core protocols. So, instead of declaring properties and parameters to pass around all the different things, you can reference one struct. For now, other Core protocols will retain their individual references to others instead of using the Environment struct–optionality needs to be reworked for that to happen.</p>

<h1 id="core-evolution">Core Evolution</h1>

<p>Pippin Core now has protocols for the following app components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alerting</li>
  <li>Appearance</li>
  <li>Bug Reporting</li>
  <li>Crash Reporting</li>
  <li>In-app Debugging</li>
  <li>Licensing</li>
  <li>Logging</li>
  <li>Data Modeling</li>

For a while now, I’ve had a repository of random Swift extensions and helper functions, dubbed “shared-utils.” A colleague of mine once remarked how bad the kitchen-sink pattern is in code organization, and it’s rung true for me ever since. Recently I renamed “shared-utils” to Pippin, to sound more Apple-y and get away from that utility name, and now today that library is marked as version 1.0.</p>

<p>The biggest change is the organization of the code: a flat list of files became separate tools to scaffold an app or perform specialized flows for accessing video or location, or working with Core Data. (Yes, there are still a ton of “utility” type files, which I swept away under a euphemistic “Extensions” rug). The different collections are all available as separate CocoaPods subspecs (with some necessary dependencies–I use extensions on Foundation in my Core subspec, for instance). Here’s the top-level organization:</p>

<h1 id="pippin-core">Pippin Core</h1>

<p>There is plenty of cool stuff in the extensions, but the things I really want to focus on are the Core and Adapter subspecs. The idea is to supply protocols that describe major infrastructural components of an app, like bug reporting, crash reporting, logging, data modeling, reading and writing. Things every major app is going to use, but may not implement the same exact way, or, as is my preference, use one of several 3rd party frameworks to avoid reinventing wheels.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the developer of my app, all externalities are considered impermanent. So, I write an adapter from a Core protocol to the 3rd party tool I want to use. If that tool should go away or be deemed unworthy at some point, I can write an adapter to a new one or even roll my own, without any change to all the apps utilizing that protocol.</p>

<p>Two adapters are provided already, PinpointKit for bug reporting and XCGLogger for logging. Each subspec describes the dependency on the respective CocoaPod so it’s only pulled if used. Ideally, there’d be a collection of adapters to each external framework that exists, but these are the ones I currently use. I also use Crashlytics, but it’s a special situation because CocoaPods will not allow you to have transitive dependencies involving static libraries. For now, the Crashlytics adapter class is provided as a separate source file in the repo only, not in any spec. It is up to the consumer to include the actual Crashlytics CocoaPod in their own Podfile and get the adapter class into their project if they want to use it. Hopefully a real Crashlytics adapter can be written once <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/6811">CocoaPods releases support for static libraries from source</a>.</p>

<h1 id="smoke-tests">Smoke Tests</h1>

<p>I worried that by splitting up the flat list into hierarchies and then separating its branches into subspecs, I’d discover dependencies between branches. I tested for this by writing a smoke test that would generate a new Xcode project for each subspec (actually, one in both Swift and Objective-C) using <a href="https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen">XcodeGen</a>, write an appropriate Podfile and install pods, and then just see if it builds. Unsurprisingly, a few things did fail, until I teased out the relationships outlined above and encoded them into the podspec.</p>

<h1 id="sauce">Sauce</h1>

<p>It’s not perfect. There are some things that don’t quite fit into their current spot, like the UIKit extension subspec’s dependency on Core, or structs that don’t actually extend anything from Apple’s API like Build or SemanticVersion. Different subspecs are in various stages of their evolution. There could, of course, be more of everything, including tests. But it’s 1.0 today so I can stop emotionally leaving it at 0.0.1 and be more realistic about how changes are evolving the codebase.</p>

<p>I write mainly for iOS, and I want something as lightweight and simple as possible to simply replace templated strings in my codebase with the appropriate values. I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/orta/cocoapods-keys"><code class="highlighter-rouge">cocoapods-keys</code></a> for some time, and it fulfills its use case very well, but it only works on secrets that are used in your application’s executable code. This means any sort of build environment tools (like Xcode Build Phase scripts) that require secrets, or <a href="https://fabric.io">things that want to use Plists</a>, won’t be able to use it.</p>

<h1 id="sed-it-and-forget-it">SED it and forget it</h1>

<p>I wrote a script to do a basic search-and-replace throughout a codebase and swap template values for actual credentials. The template values are enumerated in a file that you commit to your codebase, paired with another file that contains the actual secret values, in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.psst/keys</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.psst/values</code> respectively. The separation makes gitignoring the secret values file easy. If no secret values file exists, the script will try to expand environment variables of the same name, a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/environment-variables/#setting-environment-variables-for-all-commands-without-adding-them-to-git">common workflow for CI setups</a>. (Optionally, a path to a keychain can be supplied, if you prefer to check in your secrets to the codebase in a securely encrypted file.) It will then iterate through the keys with secrets in hand and perform the replacements.</p>

				"summary": "Describing my journey to build a photo gallery for my website using Jekyll/Liquid to template all the things.",
				"date_published": "2017-11-05T00:00:00-08:00",
        "id": "http://tworingsoft.com/blog/2017/11/05/jekyll-image-galleries.html",
        "url": "http://tworingsoft.com/blog/2017/11/05/jekyll-image-galleries.html",
        "content_html": "<p>Recently I decided that I want a photo gallery on my website, a static HTML site generated by Jekyll, just like this one. I wanted a page that lists all the albums, an index for each album that shows a gallery of all the photos, which lead to slideshow of larger images that then lead to the full raw images themselves. It turned into a fun exercise of writing Jekyll front matter and templates inside Ruby strings in a Rake task, trying to keep variables straight where data flows from one process to the next.</p>

<h1 id="inputs-and-outputs">Inputs and outputs</h1>

<p>I wanted the “input” to be as simple as possible: a directory of the images I wanted to add as an album. I decided at the beginning that I’d like all metadata about each image, such as time, location and descriptions, to reside in the image file itself as EXIF data, to ensure maximum portability and consistency. The directory name would be a slugified version of the album’s name and date as an album ID:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>photos/
	2017-10-15-my-album-name/
		image_1.jpg
		image_2.jpg
		...
	2017-11-1-another-album-name/
		image_1.jpg
		image_2.jpg
		...
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I began designing a Rake task to extract the descriptions and other EXIF data from the images and create HTML files containing the necessary YAML front matter to access in Liquid templates. Originally I thought the preprocessing should generate a directory structure like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>_photos/
	index.html
	2017-10-15-my-album-name/
		index.html
		img/
			image_1.html
			image_1.jpg
			image_2.html
			image_2.jpg
			...
	2017-11-1-another-album-name/
		index.html
		img/
			image_1.html
			image_1.jpg
			image_2.html
			image_2.jpg
			...
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>where each album’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">image_N.html</code> would contain YAML front matter for the album and individual images, respectively. Then I’d have a single collection specified in my <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>collections:
  - photos
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>and have Jekyll treat each subdirectory as a collection item, containing another sort of collection in each <code class="highlighter-rouge">img/</code> directory. I hoped it could somehow work automatically, instead of having to dynamically insert each album ID in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>collections:
  - photos
  - 2017-10-15-my-album-name
  - 2017-11-1-another-album-name
  - ...
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>which would certainly be an abuse of <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>.</p>

<h1 id="filtered-flat-files">Filtered flat files</h1>

<p>Unfortunately, this is not the way Jekyll collections are designed to work. They must all be in the same directory (the root directory by default, but recently <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/6331">support for a common subdirectory</a> was added; unfortunately this model remains too simple to implement more complicated logic and structures, as mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/6030">this issue</a>, for example). So, no subcollections, or whatever I was trying to do with <code class="highlighter-rouge">my_album_1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">my_album_2</code>.</p>

<p>The final design has two collections:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>collections:
  - photos
  - albums
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I still use as “input” to the Rake task a directory containing images, under the main <code class="highlighter-rouge">photos</code> directory (different from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_photos</code> directory!):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>photos/
	2017-10-15-my-album-name/
		image_1.jpg
		image_2.jpg
		...
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This directory path is the sole argument to the Rake task, which carries out the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask user to input the album name, description, and cover image filename</li>
  <li>move all the images to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">img/</code> subdirectory</li>
  <li>generate album YAML in <code class="highlighter-rouge">_albums/2017-10-15-my-album-name.html</code></li>
  <li>generate YAML for each image in <code class="highlighter-rouge">_photos/2017-10-15-my-album-name-N.html</code>, using data pulled from each image using <a href="https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">exiftool</a> (where N is the sequential order of the photos by time and date, sorted in the Rake task)</li>
  <li>generate a thumbnail for each image using <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">imagemagick</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The steps are designed to be as idempotent as possible, so it will e.g. read the album name, description and cover image filename from a preexisting album HTML’s YAML, or skip thumbnail generation if they already exist. After running the Rake task for the example input above, we should have the following files:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>_photos/
	2017-10-15-my-album-name-1.html
	2017-10-15-my-album-name-2.html
_albums/
	2017-10-15-my-album-name.html
photos/
	2017-10-15-my-album-name/
		slideshow/
			index.html
		img/
			image_1.jpg
			image_1-thumbnail.jpg
			image_2.jpg
			image_2-thumbnail.jpg
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>When the Jekyll build is run, each photo gallery index template will filter through <em>all</em> albums’ photos, picking out only the ones that specify the same album ID. Jekyll collections operate very similarly to MapReduce, where you have huge flat lists of items that you can filter, group and map by relations at runtime. The resulting output in <code class="highlighter-rouge">_site/</code> looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>_site/
	photos/
		index.html (album list)
		2017-10-15-my-album-name/
			index.html (this album's thumbnail gallery)
			slideshow/
				index.html (first big image in slideshow)
				2/
					index.html (next big image in slideshow)
			img/
				image_1.jpg
				image_1-thumbnail.jpg
				image_2.jpg
				image_2-thumbnail.jpg
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>One thing I haven’t quite figured out is how to force <code class="highlighter-rouge">octopress-paginate</code> to put the first slide under a subdirectory named <code class="highlighter-rouge">1/</code>, so I could have consistent navigation semantics for navigating back from the slideshow. I have an <code class="highlighter-rouge">_include</code> that constructs a “Back” button for any page, so I simply parameterized it to remain as-is (<code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;a href=".."&gt;...</code>) for the first slide, since that would pop back to the thumbnail gallery, and override it to point at <code class="highlighter-rouge">"../.."</code> for all the subdirectory slides.</p>

<h1 id="grafting-the-gallery">Grafting the gallery</h1>

<p>Originally I built a vertical list, with thumbnails on the left and descriptions on the right, extending all the way across the page (this is the layout used for the album list). This left too much negative space on the right, so I decided to go with a more grid-like layout, flowing from left to right and wrapping to the window width. Each cell would have an image with its description underneath, where the description wraps to the width of the image–this turns out to be tricky using HTML/CSS. You need to specify a width for the table for <code class="highlighter-rouge">word-wrap: break-word;</code> to work in the cell containing the description. So, I had to read the image width using <code class="highlighter-rouge">exiftool</code>, write it to the photo’s YAML front matter, then retrieve that value in the liquid tags that render the gallery HTML. In the end it’s an interesting mix of interpolating Ruby variables into shell invocations, Liquid templates and YAML front matter, and programming the use of front matter variables from Liquid templates within Ruby strings.</p>

<h1 id="slideshow-and-tell">Slideshow and tell</h1>

<p>Originally each image thumbnail linked directly to the full-size raw image. I wanted it instead to enter a slideshow to page back and forth through larger images, again with their descriptions. Each image here would then be clickable to get the raw version, to zoom using the browser’s built in tools or save. I added a new step in the Rake task to create <code class="highlighter-rouge">photos/$albumName/slideshow/index.html</code>, and inject YAML front matter utilizing <a href="https://github.com/octopress/paginate">octopress-paginate</a> to generate a slideshow page for each image. To do so, I simply set the <code class="highlighter-rouge">per_page</code> value to <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> and the collection to paginate as <code class="highlighter-rouge">photos</code>.</p>

<p>This worked great for the first photo gallery I tested with, but once I added the second, a problem surfaced: each album’s slideshow was paginating through <em>all</em> of the photos in <code class="highlighter-rouge">_photos</code>, irrespective of album. The final touch was to write a <code class="highlighter-rouge">category</code> parameter into the front matter of each HTML file in <code class="highlighter-rouge">_photos</code> that matches the album ID, and then paginate on both the <code class="highlighter-rouge">photos</code> collection and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">category</code> matching the target album for the slideshow. (Another nit with <code class="highlighter-rouge">octopress-paginate</code> is that specifying both <code class="highlighter-rouge">collection</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">category</code> outputs scary deprecation notices-which seems to grow w.r.t. the product of the amount of collections and categories-but does not break the build: <a href="https://github.com/octopress/paginate/issues/35">GitHub issue</a>. Beware that <code class="highlighter-rouge">octopress-paginate</code> does not appear to be actively maintained–the last commit was over 13 months ago now, and that GitHub issue is about the same age.)</p>

Now, I already had a hard time when deciding between certain log levels for certain situations. The first rule in SOLID, <em>separation of concerns</em>, lends a helping hand by contextualizing our logs instead of overloading the spectrum of priority.</p>

<h1 id="its-log">It’s Log™!</h1>

<p>XCGLogger, and <a href="https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack">CocoaLumberjack</a> before it, had 5 levels: verbose, debug, info, warn and error. Here are some loose rules I have for how to choose which level to use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">VERBOSE</code>: outputting the values of variables and large data structures.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">DEBUG</code>: function invocations to trace execution, additional context in hairy routines, maybe outputting values.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">INFO</code>: general events describing usage, e.g. “navigated to such and such screen” or “pressed such and such button”.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">WARN</code>: execution has left the happy path, but code exists to recover gracefully so that the app can proceed in a previous good state with minimal UX detour (e.g. showing the user a dialog).</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">ERROR</code>: a problem that will cause data loss, UX breakage, or otherwise require user intervention up to a forced relaunch of the application. I like to know about these early and aggregate them, so I use Fabric’s <a href="https://docs.fabric.io/apple/crashlytics/logged-errors.html">nonfatal error reporting</a> as part of logging at this level.</li>
</ul>

<p>That being said, I have found exceptions to every rule, and often have trouble deciding which level to use. Usually though, the best indicator is how fast you’re able to sift through your own logs–or more painfully, what you’re missing.</p>

<h1 id="level-playing-field-slippery-slopes">Level playing field, slippery slopes</h1>

<p>I don’t think I’m alone in my confusion. All sorts of <a href="http://thejoyofcode.com/Logging_Levels_and_how_to_use_them.aspx">blog</a> <a href="http://www.masterzen.fr/2013/01/13/the-10-commandments-of-logging/">posts</a> have been <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/preaction/2017/03/choosing-a-log-level.html">written</a> on the subject, outlining the author’s preferences and rules just as I have above. Of course, there’s plenty of discussion on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7839565/logging-levels-logback-rule-of-thumb-to-assign-log-levels">Stack</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2031163/when-to-use-the-different-log-levels">Overflow</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/186798/how-to-determine-what-log-level-to-use">too</a>.</p>

<p>As if it were bad enough trying to choose a log level, not all logging frameworks have the same amount of levels, or call equivalent levels by the same name:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/Level.html">Log4J</a> has <code class="highlighter-rouge">ALL</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">VERBOSE</code> and an extra level in between that and <code class="highlighter-rouge">DEBUG</code> called <code class="highlighter-rouge">TRACE</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">ALL</code> seems redundant in a system where log levels are ranked and you could just choose the most permissive level, so I like <code class="highlighter-rouge">VERBOSE</code> more here. I do like the idea of <code class="highlighter-rouge">TRACE</code>, but having to stick it in a rank between <code class="highlighter-rouge">DEBUG</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">VERBOSE</code> doesn’t seem like an easy fit.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/utrb_loglevel.html">IBM’s WebSphere Application Server</a> has a table correlating different sets of log levels from different versions of its API. It has an astounding 10 log levels (not including <code class="highlighter-rouge">OFF</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ALL</code>), including <code class="highlighter-rouge">FINE</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">FINER</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">FINEST</code>, and developers can add custom levels. I would YAGNI a few of these into oblivion if I had my way, and instead of custom levels I prefer having individual contexts that can each have its own log level or on/off switch.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-log-stands-alone">The log stands alone</h1>

<p>Individual contexts help relieve the need for more and more log levels. Adding levels seems like an attempt to cut through high amounts of noise to get to what’s really important. We want to minimize log size on disk while capturing essential information. Moving away from a monolithic log helps more here than adding log levels: it affords much more flexibility without adding more cognitive overhead at each call site.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trgnmtry/id1146667288?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Trgnmtry</a>, I had a need to log the CGPoint of a touch as it was dragging around the screen. This output a large amount of information to the log. At first I debated myself whether to log these at debug or verbose levels, but then it occurred to me that I could log them independently, using a different instance of my logging class. Now if I need to see those logs again I can flip them on and off independently without worrying about other information I might suppress or unleash.</p>

<h1 id="severely-svelte">Severely svelte</h1>

<p>For now, I’m not spending time working in a new log level. Hopefully it’s helping folks out there instead of making things less clear. At least for now they won’t have to muck with creating customizations, which would require way more magical Swift code to write with type safety.</p>

<h1 id="fossils-of-silicon-valley">Fossils of Silicon Valley</h1>

<p>Apple’s product line over the last couple of decades have become increasingly personal, and seamlessly integrated devices. Each step of the way, they’ve improved on the design and technology to high degrees of quality. Every so often those advances transformed product categories, or created new ones that changed the way humans use computers and live their lives.</p>

<p>They’ve moved from desktop computers to laptops, smartphones, and most recently smartwatches (and a few other things we’ll mention later). The iPod was a breakthrough product, albeit not the first pocket MP3 player, but also served as a test bed for the iPhone, something that couldn’t have been made at the time the iPod was released. Both technology and culture needed to catch up, and we still see that today.</p>

<h1 id="apples-and-oranges">Apples and oranges</h1>

<p>The Apple watch has been out for 3 years now, most recently offered in a model with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-04/apple-said-to-ready-cellular-capable-watch-to-break-iphone-ties">cellular capabilities</a>. The tone of the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14932046">conversation</a> around this development seems to center around what the watch can’t do that the iPhone can. If you think you’d have to read or write large amounts of text or consume media through a watch, then you might not see the puck Apple is skating towards. More likely, Apple doesn’t want you to read that long-form New Yorker essay at all, but rather to listen to it, and it might be for the better.</p>

<p>Airpods, the newest product line from Apple, are complete computers, each containing its own system-on-a-chip. With improvements to Siri, interacting with anything other than voice could wind up extremely burdensome in comparison, sending the touchscreen keyboard the way of the typewriter. Conversing with a computer while you can get up and move around is much more ergonomic than being glued to a glowing LED screen, holding your arms and head <em>just</em> so to avoid RSIs. I doubt I am alone in my instant recognition of the freedom Airpods afford when I was able to cook and clean while listening to music, a show on Netflix, and taking phone calls.</p>

<p>Glasses could visually replace a phone by placing the exact same image in your field of view, and spacial gestures could handle touch input. But why stop there? Realistically, the interface and UX would differ substantially from iOS running on a phone. There is a lot more space to work with in human vision than a little rectangle. Apple’s commitments to accessibility and design gives them a solid foundation on which to build, and I have faith that they would get it right more often than not. ARKit–<strong>A</strong>ugmented <strong>R</strong>eality–is a new and promising tool kit for developers, showing they’re extending their thinking beyond the iPhone itself. In terms of the road ahead, Airpods could themselves be the precursor to Apple glasses, the same way the iPod paved the way for the iPhone.</p>

<h1 id="i-am-the-computer">I am the computer</h1>

<p>What we know as a personal computer was born out of a terminal to a mainframe server–the hub for data and calculation. Apple’s desktops and laptops serve as the hub for the iPod, iPhone and iPad. The iPhone is now the hub for the watch. People still aren’t ready to wear smart glasses yet, so the tech still has a few years to catch up again and allow Apple to refine the watch, Airpods and Siri in preparation for the next personal computing paradigm: a modular wearable device network. A personal Internet of Things.</p>

<p>The applications and possible next steps are both exciting to think about. Imagine a sensor network in your home that allows you to “see” through walls, or IKEA furniture with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">interactive instructions</a> that points out all the parts you have scattered around on the floor. Looking forward, what could the watch/Airpods/glasses become a hub for? Is there anything left before we break the skin barrier? Is there a need for another paradigm at all, or to go that far?</p>

The more we talked about it, the more I started comparing looms to computers, as I am wont to do with, well, everything. Here are my findings from researching weaving and looms, together with what I know of how computers work.</p>

</center>

<p>A weave is a 2D construction where lengthwise (<em>warp</em>) threads intersect in various ways with breadthwise threads, thus all holding each other in place. The simplest weave is one where every warp thread alternates going under and over each pass of a single thread called the <em>weft</em>, where the starting positions also alternate between over/under. Because each warp thread can only be over or under, we could represent their positions with binary numbers: <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> for over and <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> for under. Thus, a simple weave of 6 warp threads could be described as such, where each row is a new pass of the weft, and each column is a warp thread:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>101010
010101
101010
010101
101010
010101
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Weaves need not proceed in a linear fashion. Doubling back, such as in a <a href="http://www.theweavingloom.com/weave-along-spanish-lace-weave/">Spanish lace</a>, hearkens to out-of-order processing in CPU architectures.</p>

<h2 id="patterns">Patterns</h2>

<p>You can get more interesting patterns by varying the frequency of alternations, like twill:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>101110
011101
111011
110111
101110
011101
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Different weave patterns give the resulting cloth different properties like stretchiness, flexibility, tear resistence, smoothness, or decoration. To further decorate a cloth, different colors of threads may be used. Consider this plaid pattern:</p>

<center>
	<style scoped="">
		
		#reader-adaptable-image-tartan {
		
			
				width: 25%;
			
		
		}
		@media only screen and (max-width: 500px) {
			#reader-adaptable-image-tartan { /* div containing everything after the header */
				
					width: 100%;
				
			}	
		}
	</style>
	
	<img id="reader-adaptable-image-tartan" src="/blog/img/tartan.png" alt="A plaid pattern." />
	
	<br />
	<br />
	<span class="caption">A plaid pattern.</span>
</center>

<p>There are just a few color combinations used as you move down the warp. If you gave a number to each, you could describe a pattern or family of patterns like Scottish clan tartans with a higher-level description that outlines the colors and pattern sequences.</p>

<p>Trivia: from <a href="https://www.interweave.com/article/weaving/whats-the-difference-between-tartan-and-plaid/">interweave.com</a> on plaid vs. tartan:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tartans have an identical pattern of stripes running vertically and horizontally, resulting in overlapping square grids. Regular plaids are not necessarily the same in both directions, with variation in color, size, and/or pattern of stripes. In addition, tartan is almost always woven in a two-over-two twill pattern, which forms the illusion of new colors blended from the original ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there you have it, tartans actually make use of not just particular color pattern rules, but a weave pattern that achieves a visual effect!</p>

<h2 id="looms">Looms</h2>

<p>Several types of machines called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loom#Types_of_looms">looms</a> have been devised to help assemble weaves. The Jacquard loom introduced a new dimension to the process by transcribing designs directly into representations that could automatically drive a machine to reproduce the images in weaves. An example of a predecessor to the modern day computer, it used punchcards in 1801 much like programmers in the early to mid 1900s used them in machines like ENIAC. Today, programs are written using textual languages not so different from spoken ones, which are compiled to 1’s and 0’s and run–woven?–on computers.</p>

<p>These videos demonstrate simple and Jacquard looms:</p>

<p>This is another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyhDkd8Iabs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=56s">great overview of industrial looms</a> that takes you all the way from the basics to the state of the art.</p>

<h1 id="computing">Computing</h1>

<p>The <em>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</em> can be thought of as a magic black box that takes an input and does something with it to produce an output. A simple adding computer might take two numbers as inputs, and output their sum. Digital computers don’t use decimal numbers like we do, they use binary numbers. So, if you wanted to tell a computer to add 4 and 5, you’d have to supply their binary representations. We’d tell it to add 100 and 101.</p>

<p>Suppose the computer can also subtract numbers. So, if we provide it with two numbers, we need a way to tell it whether to add or subtract. Since we have just two jobs, we may conveniently use 1 to instruct it to add, and 0 to subtract. If we put together the instruction to add or subtract together with the numbers, we can form a sort of word for the computer:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>1100101: 1 (add) 100 (4) 101 (and 5)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Let’s say our computer can add or subtract two positive numbers between 0 and 7 (7 in binary is 111, so we’re limiting ourselves to 3 binary digits per number. We’ll only ever need 7 binary digits, so we call it a 7 bit computer–(bi)nary digi(t). We could then give it a whole series of instructions, maybe in response to a person using our special calculator that has no 8’s or 9’s:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>0101010: 101 - 010: 5 - 2
0010101: 010 - 101: 2 - 5
1100100: 100 + 100: 4 + 4
0111010: 111 - 010: 7 - 2
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="programs">Programs</h2>

<p>Humans read and write computer programs using languages made of punctuation and words, instead of 1’s and 0’s. This is a C program that prints “Hello world!” on a computer screen–the canonical example when learning a new programming language:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Programs written in these so-called <em>high level</em> languages are <em>compiled</em> into a <em>low level</em> language called <em>assembly</em>. Here’s what the assembly for the above program might look like (generated using <code class="highlighter-rouge">cc -c helloworld.c &amp;&amp; objdump --disassemble helloworld.o</code>):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>pushq	%rbp
movq	%rsp, %rbp
subq	$32, %rsp
leaq	37(%rip), %rax
movl	$0, -4(%rbp)
movl	%edi, -8(%rbp)
movq	%rsi, -16(%rbp)
movq	%rax, %rdi
movb	$0, %al
callq	0 &lt;_main+0x27&gt;
xorl	%ecx, %ecx
movl	%eax, -20(%rbp)
movl	%ecx, %eax
addq	$32, %rsp
popq	%rbp
retq
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>However, we still have one more transformation before we can see what the CPU sees. Remember, the CPU works in bits, not these strange abbreviations. For instance, it doesn’t know what to do with <code class="highlighter-rouge">subq	$32, %rsp</code> (subtract 32 from whatever value is in the stack pointer <em>register</em>, where a register is a place to store a number). Each computer chip defines an <em>instruction set architecture (ISA)</em> that maps instructions like <code class="highlighter-rouge">subq</code> to a binary number called an <em>opcode</em> (the opcode for <code class="highlighter-rouge">subq</code> is 01001000; an ISA with an 8 bit opcode can support at least 2^9 or 512 different operations), which is followed by the binary representation of the inputs (there are some exceptions, but they aren’t important here). Here is the entire program in binary:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>01010101000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

<p>It might not produce an attractive woven tapestry, but it will print “Hello world!” on a computer screen!</p>

<h2 id="modern-cpus">Modern CPUs</h2>

<p>This list of 64 digit binary numbers might be fed into a 64 bit computer, like that of this Raspberry Pi:</p>

	<br />
	<br />
	<span class="caption">A Raspberry Pi circuit board.</span>
</center>

<p>Visible lines emanate from the CPU chip, just to the right of the raspberry. These are like the warp threads, each carrying its bit value of 1 or 0 into the CPU for each clock cycle (pass of the weft). (Note that you might not see all 64 of the lines leading into the CPU, or others used for power or other controls; circuit boards are actually multiple layers, of which the Raspberry Pi has 6, each with its own separate design of circuits!)</p>

<p>Each tick of the computer’s clock, the CPU goes through each of the steps to <em>fetch</em> the next number, <em>decode</em> the instruction, <em>execute</em> it by potentially <em>reading</em> numbers from registers or external memory and <em>writing</em> back any result we need to keep around. Just like looms grew in complexity to the industrial machinery of today, modern CPU architectures go further than simply carrying out instructions one by one. Chips can coordinate different components to essentially execute multiple instructions simultaneously. This video describes the technique of “pipelining” the fetch-decode-execute-read/write cycle:</p>

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eVRdfl4zxfI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>

<p>The video describes a pipeline with 4 stages, whereas Intel’s microarchitectures have upwards of 20! Pipelining itself can be further enhanced with techniques like branch prediction, out-of-order scoreboarding, pipeline interlock and stage balancing. Other facets of the CPU or ISA may be improved with extended instruction sets and SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) vectorization. Even entirely separate chips with different types of microcomponents and architectures, like GPUs (Graphical Processor Units), are used to solve different types of problems. When you’re doing billions or trillions of operations per second, having dedicated circuitry to work with particular kinds of numbers or other data makes a big difference.</p>

<h1 id="wearing-code-on-ones-sleeves">Wearing code on one’s sleeves</h1>

<p>While software written in high level language may not be as tangible as a t-shirt, computing is still as physical a phenomenon as it was when it was performed with an abacus or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepped_reckoner">stepped reckoner</a>. The same electicity in bolts of lightning or the human body is harnessed in wildly complex ways to drive today’s electronics.

At this point I can fly through all the modifier popovers and dropdowns without leaving the home keys. To boot, I’ve had a lot of practice with it lately due to the complete lack of refactoring support for Swift.</p>

<p>Xcode 9 has a brand new source editor implemented from scratch in Swift, and the Find/Replace panel I’ve come to know so well also received a makeover. After using it for a few days, I’ve found what I like about it, and what I’d like to see for the final release. Below is my critique of the UI and UX, in which I’ve done my best to leave no stone unturned.</p>

<h2 id="general-look-and-feel">General look and feel</h2>

<p>Overall, the new panel composition and design is slick, with both bold and subtle differences from its predecessor. I immediately noticed that it had been changed because I use a dark background in my source editor, and Xcode 9’s new Find/Replace panel now respects the selected themes! The differences are extremely subtle between different light and dark themes, though. For instance, in Default, the text fields’ background color is RGB(219, 219, 219), whereas with Sunset chosen it is RGB(219, 219, 218)–less than half a percent change in the blue value! Check out the differences, with Xcode 8 on top and 9 on the bottom, with both light and dark themes:</p>

	<br />
	<span class="caption">The Find and Replace panel in Xcode 8 (top) and Xcode 9 (bottom).</span>
</center>

<p><em>Note:</em> from now on throughout this post, Xcode 8 screenshots will always have a dark editor background, and Xcode 9 will have a light background.</p>

<h2 id="the-button-cluster">The button cluster</h2>

<p>The group of buttons on the right is one of the more striking changes in the new version. Before, the Find and Replace fields joined to the buttons immediately to their right, mixing the text fields and buttons in a sort of segmented control. Now, only the buttons are members of the segmented controls, their rounded corners facing those of the text fields underscoring their separation. The buttons are now shorter in height than the text fields, whereas each button is wider than it was in 8. I think at least the previous and next result buttons (“⟨” and “⟩”) and replace “All” button could lose some width, maintaining equal overall width between the top and bottom rows.</p>

<center>
	<style scoped="">
		
		#reader-adaptable-image-right-button-cluster {
		
			
				width: 75%;
			
		
		}
		@media only screen and (max-width: 500px) {
			#reader-adaptable-image-right-button-cluster { /* div containing everything after the header */

		}
	</style>

	<br />
	<br />
	<span class="caption">The right button cluster from Xcode 8 (top) and Xcode 9 (bottom).</span>
</center>

<p>The difference in margins around the text fields versus the button cluster to the right is a bit jarring to me. In Xcode 8, equal vertical spaces lie between the container edges to the text fields and attached button cluster rows, and between the two text fields and rows of buttons themselves. Since the buttons are now shorter than the text fields in height, the space between the rows of buttons is now twice as much as the space between the text fields, along with leaving unequal spacing to the edges of the container around them. I would prefer the buttons to remain the same height as the text fields.</p>

<h2 id="search-modes">Search modes</h2>

<p>The first thing that actually stood out to me (besides the obvious difference in design language) were the new case-sensitive and regex search buttons in their new home as the farthest-right accessory views in the Find field. The great news is that what used to take 5 clicks (or arrow/escape/spacebar/return key presses) now only requires one. Unfortunately, they do not respond to keyboard input, or even correctly support tab navigation (radars: <a href="http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5032133286428672">rdar://32829012</a> and <a href="http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=4960029375463424">rdar://32863002</a>). The following video shows attempting to tab to the case-sensitivity toggle and pressing spacebar (hitting tab to attempt further navigation would likewise insert a tab into the source editor):</p>

	</video>
</center>

<p>The options to restrict results to strings “starting with” and “ending with” the query are gone in Xcode 9. Personally I am fine with this since you can write regular expressions for them, using <code class="highlighter-rouge">^</code> (start) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">$</code> (end) <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html">anchors</a>.</p>

<p>One other thing removed in Xcode 9 is the “Insert Pattern” (<code class="highlighter-rouge">^⌥⌘P</code>). I personally never used this, but it appears to no longer be available even via the menu bar. If I had to guess, that was a system-wide option that was not carried over to a from-scratch rewrite (a very similar Find/Replace panel exists in TextEdit.app, with the “Insert Pattern” option–but no real regex support).</p>

<p>The dropdown to the left of the text fields for “Find” and “Replace” with the ever-present current selection has been removed. This now drops down from the magnifying glass in the Find field’s left accessory view, which in Xcode 8 opened the dropdown with all the search options. Not having to display those superfluous labels reclaims some horizontal space in the panel, which I like. The vertical lines in this image show the space saved from Xcode 8 (top) to 9 (bottom).</p>

<p>The clear button to the right of the match count label in the Find field has disappeared, which may irk some developers who prefer to point and click in the GUI. To clear the text from the field, one must now double- or triple-click, or click and drag to highlight to select all the text, and press delete. Or, for the terminal lovers, <code class="highlighter-rouge">^A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">^K</code> still work too.</p>

<h2 id="match-count-label">Match count label</h2>

<p>The count of matches, in the leftmost right accessory view position of the Find text field, previously did not display units-now it affixes “matches”. It offsets some space saved by other UI changes, but I think it looks clean and is better than having a random number hanging around. (Always <a href="https://www.opticianonline.net/opinion/letter-mind-your-units">mind your units</a>!)</p>

<p>Something I didn’t even notice until I started pulling apart the two UIs: in versions ≤ 8, holding <code class="highlighter-rouge">⌥</code> changes the “Replace” button to “All in Selection”.

<h2 id="recent-searches">Recent searches</h2>

<p>Another thing that might irk some folks is the disappearance of the “Recent Searches” list in the old magnifying glass dropdown. I know it has saved me a few times when I had a complicated regex constructed, and then forgot about the system-wide search field behavior in macOS! ⊙▂⊙</p>

<h2 id="put-a-bow-on-it-">Put a bow on it, </h2>

<p>As it’s the first beta release, and especially because this is brand new UI, there are a few rough edges. In addition to the tab-navigation problem, regex replacement currently does not interpolate capture groups <a href="http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=4928589677985792">rdar://32827938</a>.</p>

<p>Overall I’m really pleased with the new look and feel and the UX improvements that were made. I think one or two bug fixes there, along with tweaks to margins, would seal the deal for me. But, I’m already happy with the changes, and am excited to use it in its final form in Xcode 9 along with all the <a href="http://shashikantjagtap.net/hands-xcuitest-features-xcode-9/">other</a> <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/06/05/apples-xcode-9-finally-allows-ios-app-testing-over-wi-fi/">great</a> <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/the-marriage-of-github-and-xcode-9">new</a> <a href="https://iosdeveloperblog.com/xcode-9-new-feature-increase-font-size-keyboard-shortcut-cmd/">features</a>!</p>

        "content_html": "<p>One of Swift’s most notable, fundamental and pervasive constructs is the Optional, to help deal with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code> problem faced by any language with pointers. This is a great way to represent the absence of an object, and denote anything that is not required and can be absent as such. Then, you get some great ways to validate you have everything you need before working with variables to perform a task.</p>

<p>Swift, like Objective-C and many other languages before it, also has a way to divert the normal flow of execution in exceptional circumstances. So, if your validation routine decides it has hit a situation where it can no longer proceed, it can <code class="highlighter-rouge">throw</code> an error and bail out early.</p>

<p>As you shuttle data between disks, servers, and capture it from and present it to your users, you probably have many functions to perform specific transformations or I/O tasks. You have been writing more functional code since moving to Swift, haven’t you? Well, let’s talk about return types and describing function failures!</p>

<h1 id="failure-mode-code">Failure mode code</h1>

<p>Consider how many C or Objective-C APIs work: return an integer or boolean result that represents the status, -1 often representing an error in the integer case. It’s tempting in Swift to use the return value of a function to signify something went wrong, by making it optional and returning <code class="highlighter-rouge">nil</code>.</p>

</noscript>

<p>In Objective-C, the inout error parameter was the pattern to communicate errors, with a special return value to signal the error occurred. Swift  encourages the use of <code class="highlighter-rouge">do</code>/<code class="highlighter-rouge">try</code>/<code class="highlighter-rouge">catch</code> to divert execution using <code class="highlighter-rouge">throw</code>, where Objective-C discouraged using exceptions for all but actual programmer error.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/armcknight/81cc09a5185b35f2c52c2d3fa48b5ee8.js"></script>

	<p class="caption">(Code snippet hosted at <a href="https://gist.github.com/armcknight/81cc09a5185b35f2c52c2d3fa48b5ee8">https://gist.github.com/armcknight/81cc09a5185b35f2c52c2d3fa48b5ee8</a>. Enable javascript to see them embedded here.)</p>

<p>In both of these examples, assume:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the class definition and function represents your model layer</li>
  <li>the middle function definition represents your middle business logic</li>
  <li>and the statements at the bottom represents your presentation layer.</li>
</ul>

<p>I like several things about the second approach. It saves me from a clunky <code class="highlighter-rouge">guard</code> statement in the middle layer; using <code class="highlighter-rouge">try</code> clears away edge cases and the code more clearly describes intention. All error handling logic that involves user notification cohesively resides in the presentation layer, whereas in the first example there can be many places that could plausibly handle the error, forcing you to expend more cognitive process to make those decisions.</p>

<h1 id="optional-requirements">Optional requirements</h1>

<p>So then what should an optional be used for? To represent the absence of something. Not the absense of something <em>because an error occurred.</em> Just absence.</p>

<p>The difference becomes a bit more clear when you consider collections. What is the difference between an empty collection and a collection that is not there? In both cases, you have zero things that would be found in such a collection. The difference is in how all the code involved in shuffling the container from A to B must handle all possible combinations.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/armcknight/91004385bbd1a79eebe5ed9cd7bab310.js"></script>

</noscript>

<p>If you need to do some validation etc. at multiple stages along the way, you’ll need to work around the optionality of the collection. Whereas, if you always have a container, your logic can be more streamlined. The same loops and function calls work the same way whether there are 0 or 100 elements in an array.</p>

</noscript>

<p>And again, by using Swift’s error system, you’re much more expressively describing possible failures.</p>

<h1 id="if-it-walks-like-an-error">If it walks like an error…</h1>

<p>Think about what you’ll need to do with an error. In truly exceptional scenarios, the app is not going to function the way the user expects, so you’re probably going to need to show them an alert. This is a great use case for <code class="highlighter-rouge">throw</code>ing errors. You can bubble up errors from any application layer all the way to the UI, even transforming errors at the boundaries between layers. (You may want to log an error received from your server, then repackage it with a user-friendly message and propogate it through your controller logic until it reaches the presentation layer.)</p>

<p>All the intervening code paths that return things to other things might then not need to worry about optionals. That means many less <code class="highlighter-rouge">guards</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">if lets</code>, optional chaining and <code class="highlighter-rouge">nil</code> coalescing along the way. Instead, you can just prefix other function calls with <code class="highlighter-rouge">try</code> (and sometimes perhaps <code class="highlighter-rouge">try?</code>). Using these constructs to communicate errors is an abuse of the optional system and hides information about the errors that would help the compiler and other developers.</p>

<p>Swift’s error type system has recently seen improvements and I’m sure as time goes on we’ll see more improvements to the overall propogation mechanisms. They provide a great way to describe the failure modes of your routines, so always consider if what you’re really trying to communicate is best handled with Swift’s errors. I default to the strategy described here, deviating only if the model really calls for it.</p>

I believe the dependencies should be tracked, and I want to try to explain the philosophy behind why I think the way I do. I’ll do so by building from basic principles regarding tools developers use every day: compilers, source control managers and dependency managers. Bear with me for a moment, if you will:</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-compiler">What is a compiler?</h2>

<p>A compiler takes human-readable source code and translates it into machine-readable code. It doesn’t know the difference between who wrote the code, whether it was that coder that got <a href="https://www.exceptionnotfound.net/whats-your-projects-bus-factor/">hit by the bus</a> last week, or the five you had to hire to replace them.</p>

<p>Correspondingly, a linker takes the blobs of machine code output from the compiler and splices them together into one blob. This might include blobs made by other compilers at other times. As long as they are well formed and readable, the linker doesn’t care whether the blobs were just spat out by the compiler ahead of it in the toolchain, downloaded from artifactory, or any combination of those and other possibilities.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-source-control-manager">What is a source control manager?</h2>

<p>Source control managers keep a record of the changes made to any text files it knows about, as a list of important milestones in that history recorded by the developer (“commits”). It does not care who commits those changes; they are recorded the same way every time.</p>

<p><strong>I believe that all code that a compiler will compile, and all blobs the linker will link, should be tracked</strong> in a way that <em>guarantees</em> an exact replica of a binary, with minimal friction, given a single identifier (commit hash or tag). This means that the simple act of checking out a commit should give you everything you need to build the final product. No calls out to the network to get the right dependencies, which brings us to…</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-dependency-manager">What is a dependency manager?</h2>

<p>A dependency manager is a tool that takes a list of things you want to use, reduces duplications and (hopefully) conflicts, and retrieves those things. You pull a lever, and all the souce code and precompiled binaries are retrieved (usually over the network, whether it’s an in-house LAN or the internet) and written into place on your disk.</p>

<p>Think again about my earlier statements about compilers, linkers and source control. They don’t know or care about the originator of the code and blobs. On a more abstract level, a dependency manager is <em>really</em> just another code author. You may not be keying in all the glyphs that make up <a href="https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking">AFNetworking</a>, but when you instruct CocoaPods to retrieve that library’s code, you are metaprogramming to generate that source code on your machine. It then gets compiled and linked the same as your application code. Therefore I believe you should check in the code you’ve “written” using your dependency manager.</p>

<h2 id="dependency-managers-today">Dependency managers today</h2>

<p>I think we’ve heaped far too many responsibilities onto dependency managers today. If you don’t check in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pods/</code> directory, you are using it to reconstruct a fragmented source history whenever you need to recreate a previous release. CocoaPods can also be used as a way to package precompiled binaries for distribution as others’ dependencies. It makes assumptions about how your Xcode project should be structured, in terms of file locations, Xcode’s File Navigator structure, build settings, artifacts and project/workspace/scheme organization. Too much can go wrong with a simple Xcode update. It’s too many moving parts, period.</p>

<p>The only thing I want to do with CocoaPods is to pull that lever and update what I want updated. Then I can look at the diffs, commit the changes (<a href="http://tworingsoft.github.io/blog/2017/01/19/the-art-of-source-control-part-2-clean-git-history.html">as its own commit!</a>), and I’ll be able to get everything I need with a single checkout next time. I’ll be able to traverse updates to my dependencies in the same way as updates to source code I manually type with my fingers, when I do my next <code class="highlighter-rouge">git bisect</code>. I won’t have to worry about GitHub outages or source locations changing or <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm">being removed</a> the next time my CI build kicks off and tries to download the dependencies all over again.</p>

In this post, I’ll propose some simple strategies to keep all of those builds separate and easily distinguishable on your test devices.</p>

<h1 id="bundle-ids">Bundle IDs</h1>

<p>First things first: prevent debug, beta, and app store builds from overwriting each other on your test device. To do this, add a suffix to each of your non-app-store builds so they register as “different” apps on your iDevice. Here’s my setup:</p>

	<br />
	<span class="caption">Adding suffixes to bundle identifiers prevents build variants overwriting each other on device.</span>
</center>

<h1 id="app-icons">App icons</h1>

<p>Once you have multiple versions of your app on your device beside each other, you need a way to tell them apart. Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/KZBootstrap">Krzysztof Zabłocki’s KZBootstrap</a>, I wanted to overlay some information about each build onto the icons, depending on the build variant. While <code class="highlighter-rouge">KZBootstrap</code> seems like an amazing tool, I already had an Xcode project, and I wanted to insert a clean, minimal solution. I also didn’t want to bring any new dependencies in, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">imagemagick</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ghostscript</code> as in <code class="highlighter-rouge">KZBootstrap</code> and a few other solutions I found online.</p>

<p>After a little more searching, I found <a href="https://github.com/bejo/XcodeIconTagger"><code class="highlighter-rouge">XcodeIconTagger</code></a> which only uses macOS’ Automator with a Quartz filter. I modified it to get a little more flexibility out of it in <a href="https://github.com/TwoRingSoft/XcodeIconTagger">this fork</a>. Now, I can create <em>Run Script</em> Build Phases surrounding the <em>Copy Bundle Resources</em> Build Phase that first create the icon overlay, and then after copying the icons to the installation, reset the git index to discard the changes.</p>

	<br />
	<span class="caption">The Build Phases in Xcode to tag and restore app icons for build variants.</span>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">tag-icons.sh</code> is a script that wraps some of the different types of overlays I’d like, depending on the build variant, into a convenient interface to which I can simply supply either <code class="highlighter-rouge">tag</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">cleanup</code> commands. (It can be found in <a href="https://github.com/TwoRingSoft/shared-utils">shared-utils</a>.) The conditional logic that decides what to display, and invocation of the underlying tool itself, is handled inside:</p>

<p>Now, I can tell all my builds apart on my device at once. Here I have a debugging development build, displaying the git commit hash that built it; a beta build, showing the semantic and build versions; a special build that visualizes touch input, which I use to create App Store preview videos; the App Store version itself, with no overlay.</p>

        "content_html": "<p>During my time at Fabric, Apple announced their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH35-SW2">Bitcode</a> concept at WWDC (more reading <a href="https://lowlevelbits.org/bitcode-demystified/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/ios-9-bitcode">here</a>). This created new challenges to the way Crashlytics traditionally worked (and every other crash reporter available, for that matter). The usual flow went like this: when you compiled/archived your app for submission to the app store, you’d submit the corresponding dSYM binary to Crashlytics, which it uses to <a href="https://fabric.io/blog/2016/09/08/how-crashlytics-symbolicates-1000-crashes-every-second/">symbolicate</a> the stack frames in your crash report.</p>

<p>In the Bitcode world, however, the LLVM-IR bytecode you submit could be recompiled by Apple before distribution in the app store, invalidating the dSYMs submitted alongside the bytecode. (I’m not sure it even makes sense to immediately generate dSYMs for Bitcode apps at all, but I digress.) Now, after your submitted app is recompiled, you must download the new dSYMs from Apple and submit them to your crash reporter so they get the new binary addresses for your app’s symbols. (Shout out to <a href="https://krausefx.com/blog/download-dsym-symbolication-files-from-itunes-connect-for-bitcode-ios-apps">Fastlane</a> for creating a tool that helps automate this process; if you prefer a little more control, I wrote a tool called <code class="highlighter-rouge">upload-symbols</code> that ships with Fabric.app and the Fabric CocoaPod you can use).</p>

<p>We thought there would be some time before we started seeing recompilations, maybe when a new processor architecture came out, but there are other reasons Apple might want to recompile: new LLVM optimizations, or injecting code for security or DRM purposes. Indeed, we quickly found that it was happening immediately for all new apps, by testing one of my own personal apps in the store. This caused confusion for lots of our customers at the time, and to this day the process, because it requires some manual work, still trips up some developers.</p>

<p>Now, I insert a secret test crash button in all my apps, to test immediately upon release. I’ll purposely cause this crash before submitted the recompiled dSYMS, to make sure that Crashlytics’ <a href="https://docs.fabric.io/apple/crashlytics/missing-dsyms.html">missing dSYM</a> logic is working in all cases. (It is a fairly complicated state machine, after all–they must buffer crashes they can’t symbolicate, notify you, and reprocess those crashes after receiving all the required dSYMs, of which there can be more than one if your crash stack traverses external non-Apple libraries.) Then, I’ll submit all the new dSYMs, ensure the buffered crashes are processed, inspect the stack traces to make sure they make sense, and maybe send up another test crash. If my app does contain any dynamic libraries, I try to construct a stack trace that includes symbols from all of them.</p>

<p>While I have a lot of trust in the fine folks at Crashlytics, I appreciate that Apple holds the keys to the castle as far as crash reporting is concerned. As we learned at that WWDC, they can easily break the existing pipelines at any time by introducing new concepts or even making small tweaks to how they work. It behooves us as app developers to ensure that our instrumentation works correctly by building processes to validate them. So, crash your apps!</p>

<p>This release introduces a new feature: snapping to angle intervals. Without it, the angle changes continuously as you drag your finger around the unit circle. If you enable snapping to 45° intervals, for example, then as you drag your finger, the closest multiple of 45° is draw.</p>

<p>The routine that decides the closest angle went through a few revisions.</p>

<h1 id="first-attempt">First attempt</h1>

<p>First, I tried writing it specifically for a circle, knowing the range could be constrained to 360°. It did only draw angles on the appropriate intervals, but it didn’t “snap” to the next one at the right time. It should snap back and forth at the midpoint between to allowed angles, but this logic didn’t snap until you dragged all the way to the next interval. (Interestingly, the correct behavior was displayed in exactly one quadrant: the fourth.)</p>

<h1 id="second-attempt">Second attempt</h1>

<p>I wound up finding a better solution while implementing the custom input view to select a snapping angle. For this iteration of the feature, I only allow a snapping angle that evenly divides 360, so I just hardcoded the array of all such angles in [0, 360]. The input mechanism is a UISlider, so I need to map its float value to a value in this array. I wound up writing <code class="highlighter-rouge">indexOfClosestSorted</code> as an extension on Array that produces the index of the element with the closest value, seen below.</p>

<p>It turns out that I can use the very same function to snap angles. Instead of the hardcoded array of possible snapping angles, I create an array, given a selected snapping angle, of all the multiples of that angle in [0, 360]. Then it’s just a matter of calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">indexOfClosestSorted</code>.</p>

<p>This works just fine for the purposes of snapping integer angles on the unit circle, but <code class="highlighter-rouge">indexOfClosestSorted</code> is linear time. Also note that it expects the array it’s searching to be sorted. What’s another search algorithm that operates on sorted lists? <a href="https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club/tree/master/Binary%20Search">Binary search!</a> Normally, binary search returns either the location of the query in the array, or reports that it doesn’t exist. In our case, we aren’t searching for the exact value, just the <em>closest</em> one: a fuzzy binary search. The terminating and recursion conditions are slightly different, and we’re guaranteed to always get a result. Now we have a logtime search, giving us a (probably imperceptible, at Trgnmtry’s scale) performance boost for drawing. See if you can outrun it!</p>

<p>Instead, Xcode provides an autocompletion for the string <code class="highlighter-rouge">typedefBlock</code>; start typing that outside of an <code class="highlighter-rouge">@interface</code>/<code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="k">@implementation</span></code> scope, and you can accept an automatic expansion to the following:</p>

<p>This adheres to DRY principles and makes the code more self-documentingly readable. So many times, I’ve seen method after method clumsily spell out the same block signature for passing networking completion blocks down the call stack with the familiar triad of <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSData</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSURLResponse</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSError</code>, when it should have been wrapped up in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">typedefBlock</code>. Removing the actual signature from 20 places to just one would have avoided many permutations of nullability specifiers, types and parameter names between all the instances of the completion signature. you can change it much easier in the future and even add documentation comments!</p>

<h1 id="placeholder-expansion">Placeholder expansion</h1>

<p>OK, we’ve now <code class="highlighter-rouge">typedef</code>‘d all of our block declarations, and now we want to call a method containing a completion block. If you have autocompleted a method call that accepts a block as a parameter, you can tab over to that placeholder and hit Return, expanding the full block syntax needed to satisfy the parameter. This really helps me to write blocks that have return values, because for some reason I can never remember that particular piece of <a href="http://goshdarnblocksyntax.com">gosh darn block syntax</a>.</p>

<h1 id="inline-blocks">Inline blocks</h1>

<p>Xcode has one other helpful snippet to write Objective-C blocks: <code class="highlighter-rouge">inlineBlock</code>. This helps you to declare a block and store it in a variable in local scope. This makes method calls that accept multiple blocks, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">+[UIView animateWithDuration:animations:completion:]</code>, more readable at the call site. I prefer this over chaining multiple blocks directly in the parameter positions, which ends up looking awkward in Objective-C syntax and even worse when you’re reading code or diffs in viewers that wrap text.</p>

<p>In general, I don’t fully care for this approach, as you then have to read code upwards. It also annoyingly makes you repeat the parameter list. Most preferable to me is to still declare the blocks as local variables, but extract all the logic you would have written in the block to a method. This approach makes your code more readable, and your logic more testable and refactorable later.</p>

I had plenty to focus on learning the Cocoa APIs. Xcode’s configuration system is daunting in its power and flexibility, and anyways it provides you with a good enough set of defaults and migrates you on new releases to keep you running correctly.</p>

<p>A small toy app might get by this way, but serious projects need to pay careful attention to how they build their products. With a sufficiently complicated product family, build pipeline and artifact/dependency graph, maintaining the build system can become a full time job. Some <a href="http://szulctomasz.com/2015/11/14/xcode-xcconfig-files-for-maintaining-targets-configurations.html">great</a> <a href="https://pewpewthespells.com/blog/xcconfig_guide.html">articles</a> <a href="http://www.jontolof.com/cocoa/using-xcconfig-files-for-you-xcode-project/">exist</a> that detail the <a href="https://pewpewthespells.com/blog/buildsettings.html">build settings</a> Xcode offers and ways to keep your ecosystem consistent and maintainable. While I was at Fabric, we open sourced our collection of Xcconfigs: <a href="https://github.com/twitter-fabric/FABConfig">FABConfig</a>. You can find <a href="https://github.com/jspahrsummers/xcconfigs">similar repos</a> on GitHub, and I’ve even find a nice <a href="https://jamesdempsey.net/2015/01/31/generating-xcode-build-configuration-files-with-buildsettingextractor-xcodeproj-to-xcconfig/">tool</a> to extract Xcconfigs from Xcode projects.</p>

<h1 id="complex-configuration-compositions">Complex Configuration Compositions</h1>

<p>Much of Xcode’s build system’s flexibility comes from composition–you can use both Xcconfigs and the Build Settings area, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">#include</code> Xcconfigs into others. Dynamic setting expansion and platform selectors enables automatic resolution of settings based on environment or target details. Settings can be <code class="highlighter-rouge">$(inherited)</code> from multiple levels of granularity and overridden by target precedence. Xcode projects have <em>Configurations</em> defining entirely parallel sets of settings.</p>

<p>Inheritance and precedence have their own rules in Xcode, and the complex relationships arising from all the composition methods make it tough to confidently change a setting without inadvertently propogating unwanted changes elsewhere. As a concrete example, Cocoapods will inject Xcconfigs into your project, which can be inadvertently overridden in the Target column of the Build Settings editor.</p>

<h2 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>

<p>The special selector <code class="highlighter-rouge">$(inherited)</code> brings in all settings resolved at the next highest level in the build setting graph. There are three main inheritance “trunks” to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Xcode defaults -&gt; Project -&gt; Target</li>
  <li>Project -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Platform</li>
  <li>Target -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Platform</li>
</ul>

<p>This does not define a tree, however. Target-level Platform and Configuration settings can inherit from two parents, as seen in the diagram, forming an acyclic graph. I think of the first trunk as linear, and the second and third I think of as transposable from Project- to Target-level: each level of the Project trunk influences its dual in the Target trunk. Also keep in mind that each level in Xcode’s Build Settings editor inherits from the same setting in the corresponding Xcconfig.</p>

<p>In the below screenshot, you can see some build settings that have been defined in both the Build Settings editor and Xcconfig files, with settings defined at top-, configuration- and platform-levels. Each cell in the matrix defines just one value after inheriting. For instance, the Xcconfig version of the Project-level macOS-specific setting is defined as <code class="highlighter-rouge">$(inherited) XcPb</code>, and the Build Settings editor version of the Target-level iOS-specific setting is defined as <code class="highlighter-rouge">$(inherited) Tf</code>. When you look at the Resolved column, you can see how inheritance has propogated values down the line.</p>

<p><em>Note that in this example, I purposely left <code class="highlighter-rouge">$(inherited)</code> off of the Xcconfig version of the top-Project-level setting, so as not to bring a bunch of noise into the example of the architectures list repeating over and over.</em></p>

<h2 id="precedence">Precedence</h2>

<p>Precedence governs what settings can <em>override</em> those from other levels. It’s a simple linear progression, starting from Xcode defaults down to Target-level. An easy rule of thumb is to remember that settings defined in Xcode’s Build Settings editor always override the settings from any Xcconfig set for that same level. With “Levels” selected in the Build Settings editor, precedence flows from right to left.</p>

So, the same cells called out above now have the values <code class="highlighter-rouge">XcPb</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tf</code>, respectively.

<p>These simple examples demostrate the rules, but in real life things get much more complicated. Don’t be afraid to jump into your project’s build settings, and learn what they do. You many find you can greatly simplify some aspects of your build pipeline, and eliminate a few bugs on the way. Download the example projects demonstrating <a href="/blog/xcodeproj/2017-01-28-xcode-build-setting-inheritance-and-precedence/build-setting-inheritance-demo.zip">inheritance</a> and <a href="/blog/xcodeproj/2017-01-28-xcode-build-setting-inheritance-and-precedence/build-setting-precedence-demo.zip">precedence</a> used to generate the screenshots and experiment with these rules in the powerful compositional model of Xcode build settings!</p>

        "content_html": "<p>Just like <a href="/blog/2017/01/14/art-of-source-control-part-1-organizing-codebases.html">organizing a codebase</a>, git makes no prescription about how you organize the changes you make to that code. Hence, we find ourselves in another area where the practice depends on the person. The science of coding is in the compilation, type theory, runtime characteristics; how human readable languages are translated all the way down to binary that dictates physical changes in the hardware of the machine. The art I’m talking about today lies in curating the record of how the human readable code evolves via git commits. Each person’s idea of the ideal commit history lies in the balance between the qualitative judgement of which changes should be preserved due to their relevance, and practical considerations for the tools used to inspect that history.</p>

<h1 id="relevance-signal-to-noise-ratio">Relevance: Signal to Noise Ratio</h1>

<p>Some people argue that every change should be recorded in a commit. What constitutes a change? Surely you wouldn’t record a commit for each character you type, if you are adding an entirely new function to a class. What if you write the function, commit it, and then run your test suite only to discover a bug in the function? Should the fix for that bug be recorded as a separate commit in perpetuity?</p>

<p>I used to think that commits should be as granular as possible, something like the create-commit-fix-commit example above. This attempts to record the <em>though process</em> by which the final code came into being. I still work this way locally, because it provides better ability to isolate small iterative experiments. It’s also much easier to reason about a very small git diff than a huge set of changes at any time, something I frequently look at the stay on track while working.</p>

<p>After some time working this way, I realized that it doesn’t help people trying to come to grips with your code and how it evolved. If you leave commits that contained bugs fixed in later commits, you’re actually leaving dead ends in a maze for later maintainers to navigate, instead of a clean, linear evolution. Moreover, I really never even needed to retrace my steps in that way. I frequently use Xcode’s blame view, for instance, and I’d rather not see a 50 line function have a separate commit blamed for each line of code.</p>

<h1 id="tooling-practicality">Tooling: Practicality</h1>

<p>Before merging my branch upstream, I now edit my commit history to squash many of the tinkering commits into a cohesive whole with an interactive git rebase. I make heavy usage of <code class="highlighter-rouge">git commit --fixup</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">git rebase --autosquash</code> to automatically squash down those experimental/iterative commits. This helps if I can’t <code class="highlighter-rouge">git commit --amend</code> because I’ve already committed some other changes the commit I want to amend. I used to frequently <code class="highlighter-rouge">--amend</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code>, but I’ve been burned a few times after getting too eager to do so and have had to spelunk through the reflog. Now I’m more likely to <code class="highlighter-rouge">--fixup</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code> and just to do the big <code class="highlighter-rouge">--autosquashed</code> rebase right at the end.</p>

<p>Recording cohesive commits allows for easy reverting later. My concept of “cohesive” is this: if, when you ship your next release, you disover a problem with the new code, you should be able to reverse the change with a single <code class="highlighter-rouge">git revert</code> (of course, this is an ideal to strive for, not necessarily always practical in the real world). You should not have to perform as much work to surgically remove the logic as went into writing it in the first place, and you really don’t want to have to do that after getting woken up at 3 AM.</p>

<p>Git bisect can help you find out which commit to revert. What if a bug is found in a release that went out some time ago? Maybe you’re new to a project, with no knowledge of the history of the code’s evolution. <code class="highlighter-rouge">git bisect</code> is a very helpful tool in these situations, performing a binary search between the last “good” commit and the first “bad” commit, to pinpoint the commit that introduced the bug. If the code change that introduced the bug is spread out over multiple commits, understanding the context of the changes in the commit that bisection ultimately blames may be very difficult–you may not even know how many commits are related. It’s worth noting also that git bisect works best when each commit contains a code change that compiles and contains and passes all relevant tests.</p>

<p>Squashing also provides an opportunity to review all the previous messages, gather your thoughts, and write a good summary of what changed. For my first few years using git, I only ever used the short commit message or “subject”. Now, my subject lines typically only contain 70 characters (enough to avoid truncation on GitHub, in Git clients like Tower, SourceTree or GitX, or when running <code class="highlighter-rouge">git log --oneline --decorate --graph</code>). The description contains a summary and usually bullet points gleaned from all the individual commits I squashed. Github will even pull all that useful information into a PR’s description field!</p>

<p>Let’s say I have an SDK called <code class="highlighter-rouge">PlugKit</code>. It’s a new way for business owners to market and advertise their products in iOS apps. Developers can integrate just the eponymous data/networking component to completely customize how “Plugs” are displayed to their users. We also offer some prefab views available by optionally bringing in <code class="highlighter-rouge">PlugKit-UI</code>, and there’s a demo project used as a reference implementation as well as inspiration.</p>

<p>How should I organize the code for these products in Git? Should everything go in one repository? Should each of the three components get their own? <a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2014/09/09/on-monolithic-repositories/">You’ve</a> probably read <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext">many</a> <a href="https://www.bitkeeper.org/BK_Nested_White_Paper.pdf">articles</a> <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/10/monorepos-in-git/">already</a> <a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-July/102602.html">on</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@pejvan/monorepos-85e608d43b57#.tupnuwxqu">the</a> <a href="http://blog.shippable.com/our-journey-to-microservices-and-a-mono-repository">pros</a> and <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/architecting-continuous-delivery">cons</a> of <a href="http://danluu.com/monorepo/">monorepos</a>-it’s one of the great developer flame wars, up there with tabs versus spaces and functional versus OO programming. You probably already have your mind made up. What I want to do here is demonstrate some of the most basic processes I use most frequently for each possibility.</p>

<p>I’ve constructed an example of each strategy, and placed them into the directories <code class="highlighter-rouge">PlugKit-iOS-A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">-B</code>. One is a monorepo with a subdirectory containing the code for each component. The other is a directory containing each of the component repositories. Can you tell which is which?</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$&gt; tree
.
├── PlugKit-iOS-A
│   ├── PlugKit

└── PlugKit-iOS-B
    ├── PlugKit
    ├── PlugKit-UI
    └── PlugKitDemo
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It seems repository granularity has nothing to do with how your code is organized. Anything you can do in monorepos, you can do with multiple. To me, the big difference between the two is one of workflow.</p>

<h1 id="cloning-repositories">Cloning repositories</h1>
<p>Yesterday I spilled water on my laptop and fried it. Oops. The good news is that now I have one of those newfangled models with the Slide Strip or whatever it’s called. Time to pull down my code so I can get back to work:</p>

<p><strong>Monorepo:</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$&gt; git clone git@github.com:armcknight/PlugKit-iOS
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Manyrepos:</strong></p>

<p>There are many ways you could organize the repos with respect to one another. You could have a flat structure like above, in which case you’d just do:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$&gt; git clone git@github.com:armcknight/PlugKit
$&gt; git clone git@github.com:armcknight/PlugKit-UI
$&gt; git clone git@github.com:armcknight/PlugKitDemo
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>or perhaps you have your demo app pull in the others as submodule dependencies (similarly for other dependency managers like Cocoapods or Carthage):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$&gt; git clone git@github.com:armcknight/PlugKitDemo
$&gt; cd PlugKitDemo
$&gt; git submodule update --init
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>which could render</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$&gt; tree
.
├── PlugKitDemoCode
└── Vendor
    └── PlugKit
    └── PlugKit-UI
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>or how about</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$&gt; tree
.
└──Vendor
    └── PlugKit
	    └── Vendor
		    └── PlugKit-UI
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Don’t forget that <code class="highlighter-rouge">--recursive</code> flag if you have submodules in your submodules!</p>

<h1 id="writing-code">Writing code</h1>
<p>So I’m coding up a new feature that hits a new endpoint on the server, and because this is a totally new, paradigm-shifting type of data that’s coming down, we need a completely different type of UI to display it. And of course, we want to test a few “real world” scenarios and show how to implement this in our demo app.</p>

<p><strong>Monorepo:</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code># ... coding/testing/cursing/fixing ...
$&gt; git commit --all --message "I wrote and committed this all in one go, because I'm awesome"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Manyrepos:</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code># ... coding/testing/cursing/fixing ...
$&gt; cd PlugKit
$&gt; git commit --all --message "commit PlugKit changes"
$&gt; cd ../PlugKit-UI 
$&gt; git commit --all --message "commit PlugKit-UI changes, taking up PlugKit changes"
$&gt; cd ../PlugKitDemo
$&gt; git commit --all --message "commit PlugKitDemo changes, taking up PlugKit and PlugKit-UI changes"
</code></pre>
</div>

<h1 id="merging-feature-branches">Merging feature branches</h1>
<p>After some review and much pedantry, at long last we can merge our code! Woohoo! We use GitHub pull requests to merge the branches in, as well as GitHub issues to track the work we’re doing, so we’ll want to close those too.</p>

<p><strong>Monorepo:</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$&gt; git push
# go to the PR, press the big green button
# go to the issue, press the "Close Issue" button 
$&gt; git pull --ff-only
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Heck, these days closing issues may <a href="https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests">already be done for you</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Manyrepos:</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$&gt; git push
# open PlugKit PR, press big green button
$&gt; git pull --ff-only
$&gt; cd ../PlugKit-UI
$&gt; git push
# open PlugKit-UI PR, press big green button
$&gt; git pull --ff-only
$&gt; cd ../PlugKitDemo
$&gt; git push
# open PlugKitDemo PR, press big green button
# go to the issue, press the "Close Issue" button
$&gt; git pull --ff-only
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note that order may matter here. Reviewing the changes between three separate pull requests is also not great.</p>

<h1 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h1>

<p>These are some of the most basic usages of git for a typical developer, and in each case, the more repos you must deal with the more steps each task requires. These examples are simple, but each new repo introduces many new combinations of steps particular to the way you arrange everything. I only covered some basic workflows, but plenty of others are similarly more complicated in manyrepos: git bisect, rebasing to split or squash commits, conflict resolution, or just plain searching for a variable name or string (do you even have all the repos cloned and up to date to search?).</p>

<p>I used to advocate strongly for a separate repo for each individual thing being developed. I used to scoff at <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/hello-pants-build">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/218678814984400/scaling-mercurial-at-facebook/">Facebook</a> forking git/hg just to cope with their gigantic monorepos (at this point I have to wonder if some thoughtful separation could be done–working with Twitter’s monorepo <em>was</em> painfully slow). But, I realize that not only is repo division between “codebases” mostly arbitrary, it’s much simpler to keep it together unless absolutely necessary. Either you’re working on your fork of git, or you’re maintaining automation scripts to handle all the separate repos and hoping you don’t make mistakes in the manual sequences (which you will). While I’m always open to the need to split off a new repo for reasons, I’ll default to monorepos for now.</p>

        "content_html": "<p>Happy New Year everybody! Like probably many of you, I traveled for the holiday, flying on my airline of choice, <a href="http://www.jetblue.com/">JetBlue</a>. They’ve always treated me well and this last trip was no exception: our return flight was delayed a few hours, so they bought everyone dinner and gave us a $75 voucher towards our next flight. Sweet!</p>

<p>What does this have to do with passwords? Well, to manage that voucher, they use <a href="https://travelbank.com">TravelBank</a>. Cool, never heard of them, whatever it takes to get that sweet discount. They helpfully emailed me confirmation of this new account, which stated that my password would be emailed to me in a separate message. Red flag #1. Whatever, I’ll change it once I’m in.</p>

<p>I open the email containing my password to discover that it’s not a randomly generated password, but instead it’s the same password I use to log into my JetBlue TrueBlue account, which has credit card information stored. Red flag #2, and that’s a biggie. I may have 2FA set up on my email account, but I don’t expect the average internet user does.</p>

<p>I immediately go to change my TrueBlue password. It simply asks for the new password (plus confirmation). So, I fire up <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a> and generate a <a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">passphrase</a>. The form happily accepts it, and I log out to test (always do this when you change a password, you’re about to see why).</p>

<p>I cannot log into my account. “Wrong username or password.” How can this be, as I just changed it, using copy/paste no less? Like so many other account management systems, it actually does have rules governing passwords, even though the password change area under my profile settings stated none.</p>

<p>I click “forgot password” to get the password reset email with a link to the form to create a new one (which I feel is what should have happened in the first place with the TravelBank account). Aha! Passwords cannot be more than 20 characters long, well below the passphrase I had generated. The original password change form not only didn’t state this up front, but didn’t complain that my chosen password didn’t comply. Instead, it silently truncated my input.</p>

<h1 id="what-went-wrong">What went wrong</h1>

<p>I love JetBlue and of course will continue to do business with them, but they committed several sins regarding passwords and account security here:</p>

<p><strong>No initial session to set the password for a new account</strong></p>

<p>I would have preferred my voucher to be managed directly in my TrueBlue account, but since that isn’t the case, the next best thing would have been to allow me to create my own new password in a specially authenticated session.</p>

<p><strong>Emailed non-temporary plaintext passwords</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-passwords-idUSKCN0XV1I6">Email</a> is not a <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-discloses-new-breach-of-1-billion-user-accounts-1481753131">secure</a> storage medium. What if I used this password for other services as well, as <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/04/23/users-same-password-most-websites/">many people do</a>? If I were security savvy, I would go and change them all. But then, I wouldn’t have used the same password for all those services.</p>

<p><strong>Inconsistent display of password rules between password change and reset forms</strong></p>

<p>It would be very simple to have the same HTML bullet point list in the Profile -&gt; Settings -&gt; Change Password form as exists in the Password Reset form. Heck, this could even be a piece of shared code.</p>

<p><strong>Silent modification of chosen password in the input field</strong></p>

<p>Upsetting the user’s expectations like this, especially with respect to security, just shouldn’t be acceptable. A good UI should immediately present feedback regarding compliance and help the user discover and fix the error. It should never even allow the user the possibility to submit invalid input.</p>

<h1 id="welcome-to-the-club">Welcome to the club</h1>

<p>JetBlue/TravelBank are by far not the <a href="http://plaintextoffenders.com">only companies</a> to have less-than-perfect password management. A few other things I’ve seen that bother me or just leave me scratching my head:</p>

<p><strong>Prefilled passwords</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes obscured by asterisks–and in one case in plaintext–when I arrive at the login prompt. For what? Why even show the password field at all at this point? To add to the head-scratchiness, I recently received a new laptop for a new job, and the first time I visited the USBank site, it prefilled my password (after answering a security question). How? I wonder if they’re even using a not-easily-reversible hash.</p>

<p><strong>No paste password fields</strong></p>

<p>Funnily, I’ve only encountered these on mobile versions of websites, where it’s that much harder to type a password in correctly. This is why I shelled out for a password manager, but instead I’m encouraged to use a short, easily remembered password. If every service did this, I’d probably use the same password for them all. Now is that really less of a risk than hijacking clipboard contents? I don’t think so.</p>

        "content_html": "<p>I recently built up a long list of commits working on a refactor, and just realized that I rewrote a codepath that had some bugs in it. As any good refactorer (refactoror?) does, I tried to get adequate testing in place before refactoring. Unfortunately, this buggy codepath was never tested in the first place, a fact I overlooked until today.</p>

<p>So, I set out to test the code in the past, before I wrote the new code. How could this be? While building an actual time machine would make quite the pleasing pun of “all-time yak shave”, luckily for me git already has a facility to do what I want: git-rebase.</p>

<p>First things first, I gotta go back and write a new test. I left my current feature branch (let’s call it “topic”) and went back to my main branch (“master”). Then I created a new branch “tests”, and made some commits writing a test to get that rogue codepath covered. I placed as many constraints as possible on it, capturing the buggy output in test assertions. This way, when I fix the bugs, the tests should break, and I’ll update them to pass again later.</p>

<p>OK, great, now we have two diverging branches. This is the first thing git-rebase can help with. I can have it remove my original feature branch from its base in “master” and re-base it onto the head of “tests”, so it will look like I wrote that test before doing any feature work. Here’s that incantation: <code class="highlighter-rouge">git rebase --onto tests master topic</code>. The git docs have some diagrams (see the link below) as well as this <a href="https://blog.pivotal.io/labs/labs/git-rebase-onto">blog post from Pivotal Labs</a>.</p>

<p>Now all the commits are in a single history again, whew. But, I had a ton of commits on my original branch, “topic”, and some of them modified that buggy codepath, and I can’t remember which commits are now breaking that test. (Generally, I like each commit in my history to both be able to build and pass tests–otherwise there should be squashing going on (another use for git-rebase!).) Luckily, git-rebase can help me find the commit. I can have it run my test suite for each commit in my history since branching from master: <code class="highlighter-rouge">git rebase --exec "run-tests.sh"</code>. Because run-tests.sh exits with a non-zero status if a test fails, the rebase will plop me right into edit mode on the commit that broke the bad tests, so I can make the world right again.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">git-rebase</a> documentation to find out more about –onto and –exec.</p>

I remember hearing about the CSS preprocessor <a href="http://sass-lang.com" target="_blank">SASS</a> a year or two ago when I didn’t need it, as I was developing solely for iOS. I had a feeling it would facilitate organizing my stylesheets modularly and keeping them DRY, so I resolved to learn the basics before moving forward with the refactor. I’m very glad I did!</p>

<p>I learned CSS just after version 2 was released, and in all the time since have become well acquainted with the mess it can turn into if you aren’t careful. Even with care, though, CSS lacks some basic constructs that would make code much easier to maintain. Before turning to SASS, I even Googled a few things I wanted just to make sure CSS couldn’t do them on its own in some dark corner I didn’t know about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Value storage/retrieval, e.g. variables</li>
  <li>Reference of previous definitions</li>
  <li>Modular organization and importing of stylesheets*</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="footnote">*CSS has importing, but it generates additional network requests. The SASS preprocessor composes everything for you to commit and serve as one file.</span></p>

<p>SASS supports all of these things, making me a happy coder again in web-land :) Now I have a stylesheet per page or page type, which inherit from various base layers. Those base layers have definitions for abstract element types that are extended by classes with specific names appropriate for the related web page.</p>

<p>One cool thing I learned about is the mapping file generation, which helps browser web inspectors to find the original .scss or .sass file line that generated the CSS ultimately used to render the page. I even found a little trick on my own, playing in Safari’s Web Inspector: if you ⌘-hover over the inspector’s file/line .scss/.sass hyperlink, it will toggle to the SASS-compiled .css file/line instead:</p>

<p>Overall, I’m happy with my decision to switch the site’s stylesheets to SASS, and I’m happy I was able to get up and running with it so quickly. I’m sure it will make it super easy to tweak the styles for different screen sizes on phones and tablets, the piece of work I’m taking on next for the site, and also something I haven’t done before.</p>
