					<p>Much of git is mechanical and deterministic, simply tracking differences in text files. To me, this falls under the mathematical/engineering/scientific aspect of the concept. But, it is a tool used by humans, and each human will use it slightly (or vastly) differently. Finding the best practices and balancing the many powerful methods are the aspects I view as an art form. There’s no one right way to do anything, and you can make it as simple or as complicated as you like. Today I’m examining the decisions to make around how to even organize code.</p>

					<p>Happy New Year everybody! Like probably many of you, I traveled for the holiday, flying on my airline of choice, <a href="http://www.jetblue.com/">JetBlue</a>. They’ve always treated me well and this last trip was no exception: our return flight was delayed a few hours, so they bought everyone dinner and gave us a $75 voucher towards our next flight. Sweet!</p>

					<p>I recently built up a long list of commits working on a refactor, and just realized that I rewrote a codepath that had some bugs in it. As any good refactorer (refactoror?) does, I tried to get adequate testing in place before refactoring. Unfortunately, this buggy codepath was never tested in the first place, a fact I overlooked until today.</p>

					<p>I refactored the webpages here a bit to make room for this blog, and thus also the stylesheet code I’ve written so far. I remember hearing about the CSS preprocessor <a href="http://sass-lang.com" target="_blank">SASS</a> a year or two ago when I didn’t need it, as I was developing solely for iOS. I had a feeling it would facilitate organizing my stylesheets modularly and keeping them DRY, so I resolved to learn the basics before moving forward with the refactor. I’m very glad I did!</p>
