					<p>Announcing a new tool, <a href="https://github.com/tworingsoft/xcbs">xcbs</a>! Track how your Xcode schemes’ build settings change with updates to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.xcodeproj</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.xcconfig</code> files. If reading <a href="/blog/2017/01/28/xcode-build-setting-inheritance-and-precedence.html">“Xcode Build Setting Inheritance and Precedence”</a> had you on the edge of your seat, then this tool might be for you. See the <a href="https://github.com/tworingsoft/xcbs/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for more information.</p>

					<p>For probably the first year or two I developed apps for iOS, I stayed as far away from the build settings area as I could. I had plenty to focus on learning the Cocoa APIs. Xcode’s configuration system is daunting in its power and flexibility, and anyways it provides you with a good enough set of defaults and migrates you on new releases to keep you running correctly.</p>

					<p>Just like <a href="/blog/2017/01/14/art-of-source-control-part-1-organizing-codebases.html">organizing a codebase</a>, git makes no prescription about how you organize the changes you make to that code. Hence, we find ourselves in another area where the practice depends on the person. The science of coding is in the compilation, type theory, runtime characteristics; how human readable languages are translated all the way down to binary that dictates physical changes in the hardware of the machine. The art I’m talking about today lies in curating the record of how the human readable code evolves via git commits. Each person’s idea of the ideal commit history lies in the balance between the qualitative judgement of which changes should be preserved due to their relevance, and practical considerations for the tools used to inspect that history.</p>

					<p>Much of git is mechanical and deterministic, simply tracking differences in text files. To me, this falls under the mathematical/engineering/scientific aspect of the concept. But, it is a tool used by humans, and each human will use it slightly (or vastly) differently. Finding the best practices and balancing the many powerful methods are the aspects I view as an art form. There’s no one right way to do anything, and you can make it as simple or as complicated as you like. Today I’m examining the decisions to make around how to even organize code.</p>

					<p>Happy New Year everybody! Like probably many of you, I traveled for the holiday, flying on my airline of choice, <a href="http://www.jetblue.com/">JetBlue</a>. They’ve always treated me well and this last trip was no exception: our return flight was delayed a few hours, so they bought everyone dinner and gave us a $75 voucher towards our next flight. Sweet!</p>

					<p>I recently built up a long list of commits working on a refactor, and just realized that I rewrote a codepath that had some bugs in it. As any good refactorer (refactoror?) does, I tried to get adequate testing in place before refactoring. Unfortunately, this buggy codepath was never tested in the first place, a fact I overlooked until today.</p>

					<p>I refactored the webpages here a bit to make room for this blog, and thus also the stylesheet code I’ve written so far. I remember hearing about the CSS preprocessor <a href="http://sass-lang.com" target="_blank">SASS</a> a year or two ago when I didn’t need it, as I was developing solely for iOS. I had a feeling it would facilitate organizing my stylesheets modularly and keeping them DRY, so I resolved to learn the basics before moving forward with the refactor. I’m very glad I did!</p>
