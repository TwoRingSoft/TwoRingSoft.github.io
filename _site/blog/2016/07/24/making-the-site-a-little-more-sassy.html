<div id="post-content">
	<p>I refactored the webpages here a bit to make room for this blog, and thus also the stylesheet code I‚Äôve written so far. I remember hearing about the CSS preprocessor <a href="http://sass-lang.com" target="_blank">SASS</a> a year or two ago when I didn‚Äôt need it, as I was developing solely for iOS. I had a feeling it would facilitate organizing my stylesheets modularly and keeping them DRY, so I resolved to learn the basics before moving forward with the refactor. I‚Äôm very glad I did!</p>

<p>I learned CSS just after version 2 was released, and in all the time since have become well acquainted with the mess it can turn into if you aren‚Äôt careful. Even with care, though, CSS lacks some basic constructs that would make code much easier to maintain. Before turning to SASS, I even Googled a few things I wanted just to make sure CSS couldn‚Äôt do them on its own in some dark corner I didn‚Äôt know about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Value storage/retrieval, e.g. variables</li>
  <li>Reference of previous definitions</li>
  <li>Modular organization and importing of stylesheets*</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="footnote">*CSS has importing, but it generates additional network requests. The SASS preprocessor composes everything for you to commit and serve as one file.</span></p>

<p>SASS supports all of these things, making me a happy coder again in web-land :) Now I have a stylesheet per page or page type, which inherit from various base layers. Those base layers have definitions for abstract element types that are extended by classes with specific names appropriate for the related web page.</p>

<p>One cool thing I learned about is the mapping file generation, which helps browser web inspectors to find the original .scss or .sass file line that generated the CSS ultimately used to render the page. I even found a little trick on my own, playing in Safari‚Äôs Web Inspector: if you ‚åò-hover over the inspector‚Äôs file/line .scss/.sass hyperlink, it will toggle to the SASS-compiled .css file/line instead:</p>

<center>
	<style scoped="">
		
		#reader-adaptable-image-sass-vs-css-web-inspector-link {
		
			
				width: 1200px;
			
		
		}
		@media only screen and (max-width: 500px) {
			#reader-adaptable-image-sass-vs-css-web-inspector-link { /* div containing everything after the header */
				
					width: 100%;
				
			}	
		}
	</style>
	
	<img id="reader-adaptable-image-sass-vs-css-web-inspector-link" src="/blog/img/sass-vs-css-web-inspector-link.png" alt="Safari's Web Inspector showing a link to the relevant SASS source (left) and the compiled CSS file (right) when ‚åò-hovering." />
	
	<br />
	<span class="caption">Safari's Web Inspector showing a link to the relevant SASS source (left) and the compiled CSS file (right) when ‚åò-hovering.</span>
</center>

<p>Overall, I‚Äôm happy with my decision to switch the site‚Äôs stylesheets to SASS, and I‚Äôm happy I was able to get up and running with it so quickly. I‚Äôm sure it will make it super easy to tweak the styles for different screen sizes on phones and tablets, the piece of work I‚Äôm taking on next for the site, and also something I haven‚Äôt done before.</p>
