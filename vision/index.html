<center>
	Our guiding philosophies are built on a dharmic model of interaction in the world via software. This governs how we interact as developers working on the code, how users and developers interact over the product, and how the product affects the interaction between its users (or even nonusers).

<br />

<ul>
	<li>Quality: deliver software that is safe, robust and maintainable–that means code that is tested, well-factored and documented.</li>
	<li>Harmony: we may not be the first or last to touch a codebase; respect the decisions of those that have come before, and try to leave it better than we found it for those who come after.</li>
	<li>Duty: our products are meant to help those who use it–seek to understand their problems and empathize with their needs.</li>
	<li>
		Morality: cultivate respect and compassion between...
		<ol>
			<li>developers–leave ego behind when solving problems and teaching others;</li>
			<li>developers and users–shun psychological tricks and exploitative practices;</li>
			<li>users–encourage healthy lifestyles and maintain humanity.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ul>

	We strive for simplicity and elegance in every aspect of our products, whether in code or user experience.
