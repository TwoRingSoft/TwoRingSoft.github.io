Announcing a new tool, [xcbs](https://github.com/tworingsoft/xcbs)! Track how your Xcode schemes' build settings change with updates to your `.xcodeproj` and `.xcconfig` files. If reading ["Xcode Build Setting Inheritance and Precedence"](/blog/2017/01/28/xcode-build-setting-inheritance-and-precedence.html) had you on the edge of your seat, then this tool might be for you. See the [README](https://github.com/tworingsoft/xcbs/README.md) for more information.

Here's to increased stability and maintainability in your Xcode projects!
